# The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology

_Have you ever wondered “What would be the benefit of having genomic surveillance capacity?” This chapter attempts to answer that question. In the following sections we describe the utility of pathogen genomic data for public health surveillance and outbreak response. We also discuss how genomic data can remain useful even when they are not available in real time. This section should be pertinent to most readers, since it provides a broad rationale for why genomic surveillance and genomic epidemiology help support applied epidemiology activities._

## The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance.

Genomic data provide additional resolution to determine relationships between cases. From a surveillance standpoint, this ability to delineate relationships allows public health practitioners to delineate separate lineages circulating within a particular area of interest. This capacity allows the epidemiologist to see distinct chains of transmission that circulate in the area of interest concurrently. Importantly, in times of concurrent transmission, these separate transmission chains may be challenging to differentiate from case surveillance data alone.

What is the benefit of detecting these distinct transmission chains? Firstly, this additional layer of resolution enables the public health practitioner to detect the emergence or introduction of new lineages into their community or surveillance area, and distinguish introduction events from endemic transmission within the surveillance area. Developing a more precise understanding of how the processes of introduction and endemic transmission drive incidence within your area allows public health authorities to intervene in more precise and tailored ways. For example, if most cases within the surveillance area result from multiple introductions of distinct lineages that transmit only minimally within the surveillance area, then policies that seek to reduce the introduction of disease from other areas are likely to be more effective in reducing case counts. In contrast, if most cases are attributable to a single circulating transmission chain within the surveillance area, then public health policies focusing on reducing travel-acquired cases are likely to be less effective, and greater focus should be oriented towards public health interventions designed to interrupt transmission within the community.

Additionally, the ability to distinguish between different circulating pathogen genotypes allows the epidemiologist to see the different extent to which different transmission chains contribute to transmission, and how these contributions change through time. For example, perhaps you detect four circulating genotypes within your community. Despite the existence of these four transmission chains, the majority of the cases in your community can be attributed to the circulation of just one of these transmission chains. In this case, the public health practitioner can focus attention on understanding what risk factors or demographic profiles appear most associated with the primary circulating transmission chain, with the hope that a more detailed understanding of that particular transmission chain will underscore more tailored and effective interventions.

Evaluating the contribution of different pathogen genotypes to case counts over time can provide further situational awareness in the form of detecting genotypes that may have different phenotypic presentation. For example, an accelerating proportion of cases attributable to a particular genotype may indicate a more transmissible lineage, or a change in common symptoms or severity associated with an increase in a particular genotype could indicate a change in the clinical presentation of illness possibly associated with a genotypic change in the pathogen. As epidemiologists are well aware, epidemiologic and demographic patterns may well be the case of lineage frequency changes, and thus simply observing frequency changes does not denote a genotype-phenotype connection. Rather, monitoring case counts with a further understanding of how different genotypes contribute to incidence enables precise monitoring that may alert public health authorities to a situation that requires deeper epidemiologic investigation.
