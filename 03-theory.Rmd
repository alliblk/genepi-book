# Fundamental theory in genomic epidemiology

_One of the strengths of incorporating genomic data into epidemiological investigations is that it provides an additional, independent data stream by which to assess infectious disease dynamics. One of the challenges that comes hand-in-hand with that strength is that genomic epidemiology uses theory, analytical approaches, and jargon that surveillance epidemiologists may not be familiar with. In this Chapter we introduce the fundamental theory that underlies genomic epidemiological analysis and describe the terminology that genomic epidemiologists frequently use in describing and interpreting our analyses. This chapter, which summarizes the principles and mechanics of genomic epidemiology, should be pertinent to most readers of this handbook._
