Currently there is a gap in the genomic epidemiology literature. There are excellent review papers providing short, accessible summaries of how pathogen genomics can support aims in public health (e.g. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1813907). On the other end of the spectrum are scientific papers describing technical methods and findings of genomic epidemiological studies of various pathogens. We felt that something was missing from the middle; an open resource that introduced the basic theory and utility of genomic epidemiology in public health practice, and provided step-by-step guidance for investigating common questions. To this end, we have strived to create a resource that will help readers: Understand how genomic epidemiology can support certain investigations, Implement genomic surveillance systems, and Apply genomic epidemiology to routine investigations in public health practice. 1.2 What this handbook is not. This resource is not a review of the primary literature in genomic epidemiology, nor do we aim to provide an exhaustive description of all the questions that scientists can investigate with genomic epidemiology. We will not present every method for genomic epidemiological analysis, nor will we provide information on the entire suite of available analytic tools. Rather, this handbook is meant as a practical guide to applied genomic epidemiology. As such, we focus on the questions that we have seen public health practitioners encounter most frequently, and present analytical methods and tools that are easily used within public health departments and other applied epidemiology settings. 1.3 Who is this handbook written for? We have designed this handbook to support the use of genomic epidemiology in public health decision making and outbreak response. This book is for you if you are already involved in, or want to develop a program for, genomic data collection, genomic data analysis, genomic data interpretation, and/or policy evaluation in public health. For example: Public health microbiologists or lab directors developing a genomic surveillance program. Bioinformaticians working in public health, and wanting to increase their familiarity with the goals, theory, and approaches specific to genomic epidemiology. Epidemiologists who typically work with surveillance data, but who want to integrate molecular information as well. Health officers or other policy makers who want to understand more about pathogen genomic data as a source of epidemiological information. Academics collaborating with a public health institution who want to learn more about genomic epidemiology in applied public health settings. 1.4 How should you read this handbook? You can think of this resource as funnel-shaped, moving from imperative concepts that all readers should find useful towards more specific implementation information that is most pertinent for those readers specifically involved in data collection and analysis. We recommend that all readers read the first two chapters introducing the utility of pathogen genomics in public health and the fundamental theory underlying genomic epidemiology. These two sections will help you understand how genomic data enrich public health investigations and the basic mechanics behind genomic epidemiology. These sections will also help to introduce common language for discussing phylogenetic trees. Readers involved in designing or implementing genomic surveillance and epidemiology programs within their agencies should also read the sections on sampling strategy and broad use cases for genomic epidemiology. These sections will help outline in more detail how to approach data collection and analysis for common topical areas and questions we see public health departments seeking to investigate with genomic epidemiological approaches. From there, readers who wish to see investigations falling under these different use cases in action should read the “Case studies” section. Our intent with the case studies is to show step-by-step why we initiated an investigation, how we framed our question of interest, and how we investigated it, including quality control, evaluating competing hypotheses, and weighing uncertainty. While narratives presented in the published literature are by design cohesive and smooth, with these case studies, we aim to show exactly how an investigation occurred, including bumps and questions along the way. Finally, we have a section on “Tools and methods”, which lives towards the end of this handbook since it is primarily pertinent to those readers actively involved in genomic epidemiological analysis. "],["the-value-of-pathogen-genomics-in-applied-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. 2.3 The value of retrospective data", " Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology Have you ever wondered “What would be the benefit of having genomic surveillance capacity?” This chapter attempts to answer that question. In the following chapter we describe the utility of pathogen genomic data for public health surveillance and for outbreak response. We have distinguished between surveillance and outbreak response use cases for two reasons. Firstly, the turnaround times for which genomic data retain utility are different for surveillance versus outbreak response. Typically, outbreak response requires sequencing and genomic analysis to occur more rapidly. Secondly, the sampling frames that you would use for surveillance are different from what you would use for outbreak response. We will elaborate on sampling frames in Chapter 4 of this resource. Finally, we recognize that getting a genomic epidemiology program up and running can be slow and challenging. We therefore discuss how genomic data can remain useful even when they are not available in real time. This chapter should be pertinent to most readers, since it provides a broad rationale for why genomic surveillance and genomic epidemiology help support applied epidemiology activities. 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. Genomic data provide additional resolution to determine relationships between cases. From a surveillance standpoint, this ability to delineate clusters of related cases more sensitively allows public health practitioners to see separate pathogen lineages circulating within a particular area of interest. This capacity allows the epidemiologist to see distinct chains of transmission even when they circulate in a population concurrently, a finding that can be challenging to see in case surveillance data alone. What is the benefit of detecting these distinct transmission chains? Firstly, this additional layer of resolution enables the public health practitioner to detect the emergence or introduction of new lineages into their community or surveillance area, and distinguish introduction events from endemic transmission within the surveillance area. Developing a more precise understanding of how the processes of introduction and endemic transmission drive incidence within your area allows public health authorities to intervene in more precise and tailored ways. For example, if most cases within the surveillance area result from multiple introductions of distinct lineages that transmit only minimally within the surveillance area, then policies that seek to reduce the introduction of disease from other areas are likely to be more effective in reducing case counts. In contrast, if most cases are attributable to a single circulating transmission chain within the surveillance area, then public health policies focusing on reducing travel-acquired cases are likely to be less effective, and greater focus should be oriented towards public health interventions designed to interrupt transmission within the community. Figure 2.1: Epidemiologic curves without and with the addition of genomic data. On the left we see the epi curve without genomic information. Given just the shape of the curve, we might infer that this outbreak started from a single introduction event with some degree of sustained transmission. On the right we see the same epi curve, but with cases coloured according to their genotype. The addition of genomic data suggests that in fact this outbreak is attributable to three distinct introduction events of divergent genotypes, and that these different genotypes contributed in different degrees to the overall outbreak. Beyond simply detecting distinct transmission chains, genomic surveillance data can enable the epidemiologist to see how different clusters contribute to the overall picture of transmission. For example, perhaps you detect four circulating genotypes within your community. Despite the existence of these four transmission chains, the majority of the cases in your community can be attributed to the circulation of just one of those transmission chains. In this case, the public health practitioner can focus attention on understanding what risk factors or demographic profiles appear most associated with the primary circulating transmission chain, with the hope that a more detailed understanding of that particular transmission chain will underscore more tailored and effective interventions. Furthermore, evaluating the contribution of different pathogen genotypes to case counts over time can provide more precise situational awareness about how different variables shape the epidemiology of a pathogen. For example, we may be concerned about how travel and holiday behavior contribute to cross-border pathogen spread. Genomic surveillance data can enable us to investigate that question, monitoring the prevalence of particular genotypes in different countries and observing changes in genotype-specific incidence rates following major travel periods. Such analyses enabled epidemiologists to monitor the rise of the 20E lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Europe during the summer of 2020, attributing the rising dominance of the variant to holiday travel, rather than to increased viral fitness or transmissibility (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03677-y). However, sometimes more fit lineages of a pathogen do emerge; here again genomic surveillance data can provide fast situational awareness. By monitoring genotype-specific incidence rates, we are well poised to detect an acceleration in transmission of a particular lineage. Enabled with high-resolution descriptive epidemiological information, we can follow up with analytical epidemiological studies to test hypotheses about why a particular strain is rising in frequency. This exact process was critical to detecting the emergence of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) in the United Kingdom, and attributing the rise in frequency to the actual increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03470-x)(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg3055) Finally, a change in commonly-reported symptoms or illness severity associated with an increase in a particular genotype could indicate a change in the clinical presentation of illness, possibly associated with a genotypic change in the pathogen. Figure 2.2: Toy example of monitoring genotype frequencies. In the top panel of this figure we show a theoretical incidence plot. Below, the same incidence plot is shown given the addition of genomic data, which now allows us to measure genotype-specific incidence. Having a genotype-specific measure of incidence allows us to see how the frequency of different genotypes changes over time. Importantly, that information can provide critical situational awareness about an outbreak, providing warnings of genotypes that we may need to monitor more closely. 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. Pathogen genome sequences can help us detect or rule out linkages between cases. Similarly to how specific case definitions improve the sensitivity of traditional epidemiologic study designs, genomic data can support outbreak response by improving one’s ability to accurately classify which cases form an outbreak cluster. Below are some toy examples to clarify how this works, and to demonstrate how this information is useful in guiding public health practice. In this first toy example, imagine that three skilled nursing facilities in your community are all experiencing outbreaks of a particular illness. As spaces of congregate living, typically housing more vulnerable people, such facilities may be more prone to higher incidence of disease. Thus you may ask yourself, are the outbreaks I see in these three facilities independent outbreaks, attributable simply to the higher risk setting? Or might these outbreaks actually be linked? Furthermore, are all of the cases detected within the facilities linked? Or do some cases form a cluster, while others have simply been detected due to enhanced screening? Figure 3 below shows how genomic data can help elucidate some of these possibilities. From the surveillance data we can see that we have cases detected across all three SNFs. When we sequence the viruses from those infections, an interesting picture unfolds. Each SNF has a subset of cases with closely related genome-sequences (indicated here by colour). Each SNF also has cases whose genome sequences are distinct from each other and from the related infections found across all of the SNFs. This theoretical picture helps us understand a few things. Firstly, these are not three independent outbreaks, but rather one outbreak across three facilities. This may cause us to ask are residents transferred between facilities regularly? Do staff members work at multiple facilities? How can we limit inter-facility transmission? Secondly, not all of the cases that were detected across the SNFs are related to the outbreak. Rather, we have one primary cluster. Additionally, we have detected other cases of the disease that were likely acquired in the community, separately from the outbreak. Figure 2.3: Cases of a disease across three skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), without and with genomic sequencing data. In the first row we see that we have multiple cases of disease across three separate institutions. Without any additional knowledge about the cases, we might conclude that each SNF is experiencing an independent outbreak. The addition of genomic sequence data suggests that these SNFs are in fact all part of the same outbreak, given that they each of cases that are infected with the same genotype of the disease. Furthermore, the sequence data allows us to see which cases are really part of this multi-facility outbreak, and which infections are in fact unrelated prevalent cases detected through outbreak response efforts. Similarly, genomic data can distinguish cases that are not linked, even if they are detected within the same setting or facility, or infect individuals with similar demographic profiles. Distinguishing between unrelated and related cases within a single setting can enable epidemiologists to more clearly see what precise factor is leading to transmission. Let us take another toy example, in this case a factory where you detected an elevated incidence of disease above baseline. The cases are distributed across the factory, among both managerial staff who primarily work in offices and individuals working in assembling products. All the cases have been detected around the same time period, meaning that temporal pattern supports a single outbreak across the entire facility. In that case, what factor is facilitating transmission? How will you act in order to interrupt transmission? Figure 4 below shows how the addition of genomic data enables you to see that the cases among office-based managerial staff are unrelated to the cases occurring on the assembly line. While all cases occurred among employees of the factory, infections among managerial staff are genetically distinct from cases that occurred among assembly staff. Therefore, managerial infections appear to have been acquired externally from the workplace. In contrast, all cases among assembly staff are genetically related. Distinguishing the office staff cases from the case assembly staff cases allows you to see that any transmission occurring within the factory appears to be specific to the assembly area of the factory. This improves the sensitivity with which you can detect the factors or behaviors that are facilitating transmission, and hopefully making it easier to intervene. Figure 2.4: Here we see how the addition of genomic data changes our understanding of transmission within a factory. On the left, we see seven cases of infection, all within the same factory. This may lead us to believe that all of these cases are related, and perhaps became infected at work. The addition of genomic data helps us resolve this picture more. Once we have genotype information, we see that cases that work on the assembly floor all appear related, while cases among individuals who work in the offices appear unrelated, and are likely prevalent cases detected through enhanced surveillance efforts. Determining that workers in the office are not part of the factory outbreak helps us see that the occupational transmission risk appears related to work on the assembly line. This would allow us to target our intervention efforts towards this group of workers. 2.3 The value of retrospective data In public health we frequently want short turnaround times such that we can learn and act as quickly as possible. However, initially you might have delays in generating sequence data. While decreasing turn-around-times will help you to utilize the data in real-time to inform outbreak response, genomic data that are retrospective in nature are still useful! Sequencing retrospective samples can increase or change our understanding of the dynamics and timing of outbreaks. For example, sequencing older samples retrospectively might identify earlier detections of particular pathogen lineages, therefore suggesting that a lineage might be more prevalent in the present than assumed. Similarly, hypotheses about the role of particular events in initiating transmission or disseminating an outbreak might be altered or dismissed based on retrospective data. An early sequence might also become a “missing link” that adds weight towards a hypothesis that two distinguishable local transmission chains arose locally and were not the result of two separate introduction events. While it is rare for retrospective samples to be paradigm-shifting, we will nonetheless look into a handful of very extreme examples to show the kinds of phylogenetic insights retrospective samples may lead to. The HIV-1 group M pandemic resulted from a spillover event from central African chimpanzees, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was a likely starting point. However, owing to the late identification of HIV as the causative agent, the earliest genetic sequences of HIV-1 come from samples collected in the 1980s, likely multiple decades after the initial spillover event from chimpanzees into humans. With many years of transmission and evolution occurring before viruses were ever sequenced, the genome sequences from the 1980s are already quite divergent. Retrospective samples identified from two blood samples collected in Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, in 1959 and 1960 were illuminating. Both samples belonged to different subtypes of HIV-1 group M and thus indicated that substantial genetic diversity of HIV-1 was already present in the DRC by 1960. This finding helped revise our understanding of the origins of the HIV-1 pandemic, pushing back our estimates of when HIV-1 group M viruses spilled over into the human population to towards the turn of the century, a period of time involving rapid urbanization in central Africa. Figure X: Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 sequences from Worobey et al (2008). A similar and even more exaggerated example comes from ancient hepatitis B virus samples. Hepatitis B virus is a circular double-stranded DNA virus that infects hepatocytes and causes hepatitis. A number of genotypes of hepatitis B have been described, and genetic diversity tends to correspond to broad geographic regions. Because hepatitis B virus has a DNA genome, and double-stranded DNA is relatively stable, it has been possible to extract DNA from well-preserved hundreds to thousands year-old remains from all around the world. This work has allowed us to sequence ancient HBV viruses and compare them to contemporary sequences. One of the most surprising findings of these studies has been that all historical hepatitis B virus sequences to date clearly fall within known contemporaneous genotypic hepatitis B diversity, indicating that the diversification of hepatitis B virus predates any of the ancient samples. Figure X: Phylogenetic network of hepatitis B virus sequences from Krause-Kyora et al (2018). In both the HIV-1 group M and hepatitis B virus studies, retrospective sequencing provided a lot of new information because no information existed prior to contemporary sequences. Though this information isn’t actionable for any response happening now, it does nonetheless paint a much clearer picture of when these viruses emerged, and puts constraints on hypotheses about past events. Even though we have explored examples with timescales on the order of decades to hundreds of years, the broader lessons would hold in a similar contemporary situation. Even when data from an epidemic are plentiful, we may still have local blindspots. One example of this has been the Guinean portion of the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic, where a seemingly rare viral lineage was detected by three different groups who were sequencing sporadically during the epidemic. Each time the lineage was detected, it seemed to circulate at such low prevalence that each set of investigators thought that the lineage would likely not persist beyond the study period. The persistence of this lineage is remarkable because it was only ever detected at low frequencies despite reasonably robust genomic surveillance within Guinea, and yet it circulated for much of the outbreak. A potential hypothesis arising from these data is that this lineage actually circulated at higher frequencies, allowing the lineage to be sustained over long periods, but that it circulated in an area within Guinea where case detection or sequencing coverage was not as dense. When the lineage reached areas with good sequencing coverage it was observed, but only rarely. If we assume that PCR testing were done at the source location, and that those samples were somehow preserved, retrospective sequencing in regions of Guinea where sequencing was less intense could illuminate the circumstances that allowed this lineage to circulate for so long while only rarely being detected. At the end of the day, situations where retrospective sequencing can significantly alter our perspective will be more common in resource limited settings, and it is far more common for retrospective sequence data to fill in gaps and confirm transmission that we expect was happening. A clear example of this comes from the Seattle Flu Study, which ran in the Seattle area from January 1 to March 15, 2020. The goal of the study was to collect a large volume of samples from volunteers self-reporting respiratory symptoms. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the US was an individual returning from Wuhan on January 15, 2020 while the first case of community-acquired infection was 28 February, 2020. Samples collected during the Seattle Flu Study happened to include 65 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, including numerous samples spanning the time between the first travel-related case (January 15) and the first detected case of community transmission (February 28), thus filling an important gap in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during a time when the virus was establishing local transmission. "],["fundamental-theory-in-genomic-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 3 Fundamental theory in genomic epidemiology", " Chapter 3 Fundamental theory in genomic epidemiology One of the strengths of incorporating genomic data into epidemiological investigations is that it provides an additional, independent data stream by which to assess infectious disease dynamics. One of the challenges that comes hand-in-hand with that strength is that genomic epidemiology uses theory, analytical approaches, and jargon that surveillance epidemiologists may not be familiar with. In this Chapter we introduce the fundamental theory that underlies genomic epidemiological analysis and describe the terminology that genomic epidemiologists frequently use in describing and interpreting our analyses. This chapter, which summarizes the principles and mechanics of genomic epidemiology, should be pertinent to most readers of this handbook. "],["sample-selection.html", "Chapter 4 Sample selection 4.1 Representative Sampling 4.2 Targeted Sampling 4.3 Contextual data", " Chapter 4 Sample selection In this Chapter we describe two major approaches to sample selection for genomic epidemiological studies. We describe when you should use these different sampling strategies, focusing on which types of questions you may be interested in, and how the particular sampling strategy supports the goal of your investigation. This Chapter is pertinent for any readers who are actively seeking to implement genomic surveillance programs and integrate genomic epidemiology into their public health investigations. Readers who want to understand why different sampling strategies are useful will also benefit from reading these sections. 4.1 Representative Sampling In representative sampling, a set of specimens are selected for sequencing such that the pathogen genetic diversity in the sequenced sample set is representative of the pathogen genetic diversity circulating in the broader population. This means that the investigator should be able to detect the same suite of genotypes in their sample as circulate in the broader population, and that the frequencies with which they observe different genotypes in their sequenced dataset should reflect the frequencies with which those genotypes are found in the broader population. To maintain these attributes and protect the validity of their dataset, the investigator must ensure that they do not accidentally enrich for certain genotypes by preferentially sequencing samples that have a particular diagnostic trait, a particular clinical presentation, or affect a particular demographic group. Furthermore, to maintain a representative dataset, the investigator must also avoid systematically excluding certain genotypes that are circulating in the population. Genotype exclusion can occur when you lack sequences from a particular portion of your population that does not mix homogeneously with everyone else in your population. For example, if you have an under-served population that co-mingles, but has limited contact with other groups in your community, then a certain pathogen genotype could circulate primarily within that community. If that population lacks equitable access to testing, then you may not detect transmission within the community or sequence the circulating genotype(s). This situation would lead you to miss or underestimate the prevalence of those genotypes. Generally, we recommend using representative sampling when exploring surveillance questions, such as: What is the frequency of this variant in my population? How are frequencies of these different variants changing over time? What is the spatial distribution of different pathogen genotypes? When was this particular pathogen genotype introduced to this population, and how long has it circulated for? How much pathogen diversity do we observe in our community, and how does this relate to pathogen diversity in other communities? 4.2 Targeted Sampling In targeted sampling we aim to sequence as many samples as possible from a particular population, outbreak, or transmission chain, in order to understand the specific genotypes and disease dynamics associated with that population or setting. Examples of when we use targeted sampling include: Investigating populations showing particular clinical presentations of a disease to see whether a specific pathogen genotype appears correlated with an altered disease presentation. Exploring whether an outbreak in a localized setting, such as a workplace, school, or medical facility, is the result of transmission occurring within the setting. Alternatively, infections could be acquired in the broader community, and simply detected in the localized setting, for example due to increased screening in the facility. Investigating a particular set of cases that report an epidemiologic link to determine whether they are indeed part of the same transmission chain. Investigating individuals presenting with a second acute period of illness, to distinguish between a reinfection event and reactivation of latent disease. 4.3 Contextual data Targeted sampling focuses on deeply sampling particular settings, transmission chains, or infections that meet case definitions. Yet, to analyze those datasets appropriately, you need to include representatively-sampled genome sequences alongside your targeted samples. Within genomic epidemiology, we often refer to these other representative samples as contextual data. They provide a backdrop for what is happening more broadly outside of your densely sequenced target population, and can improve analytic inferences. Importantly, they also serve as controls, enabling you to see whether dynamics observed in your targeted population are unique to that population, or whether they are typical of the broader set of sequenced cases. 4.3.1 Contextual data as a backdrop Including contextual data in the analysis of transmission dynamics within a targeted setting enables the public health practitioner to see whether the pathogen genotypes associated with the outbreak circulated in the community before and/or after the outbreak. This contextual information can potentially clarify how an outbreak began, and when it has truly ended. Furthermore, including contextual data in a targeted analysis can help elucidate links between an outbreak in the targeted population and transmission in the broader community. That information can help the epidemiologist to see whether an outbreak amplified transmission and seeded it in the broader population. Additionally, if the bounds of an outbreak aren’t truly known, representative samples that appear related to targeted samples may indicate a connection to the outbreak that was not previously known. Finally, including sequences sampled over longer time periods will make estimates of the molecular clock more accurate, and often more precise. When the cases of interest within your targeted analysis occur over a short time window, as in the case of small, localized outbreaks, including contextual sequences sampled over longer periods of time will ensure that your time tree analyses remain accurate. 4.3.2 Contextual data as controls Imagine that you are interested in a cluster of illnesses that have a different disease presentation. You wonder whether a change in the pathogen itself might be responsible for the changed clinical manifestation. To investigate, you decide to sequence pathogen genomes from cases that meet a case definition for the new clinical presentation. In the absence of an association between pathogen genotype and disease presentation, you may find that all of these individuals with similar disease presentations are infected with distinct and diverse pathogen genotypes. However, what if the individuals who meet your case definition are infected with the same or similar genotypes? Does that mean that there is an association between the genotype and disease presentation? Not necessarily. Only looking at sequences from individuals showing a specific clinical course would be like only looking at the people who got sick after eating at a “poisoned picnic”. If every sick case at the picnic ate the potato salad, then you might conclude that the potato salad is to blame. But what if everyone ate the potato salad, including your controls who did not get sick after the picnic? Then the potato salad is probably not the culprit. The validity of your study depends on the controls. Similarly, representatively-sampled contextual sequences act as controls in genomic epidemiological analyses. They allow you to see which pathogen genotypes circulate in individuals not presenting with the altered clinical course. Much like the case where everyone at the picnic ate the potato salad, it is completely possible that a particular genotype is dominantly circulating in a community and causing infections with varied clinical presentations. If this is the case, then your targeted samples may all be infected with the same genotype, but your representatively-sampled contextual sequences will also show that same genotype. Just like controls in traditional epidemiological studies, contextual sequences should be collected from individuals who would have been sequenced as part of your targeted sampling effort had they fit the criteria that is guiding your targeted sampling effort.

These case studies illustrate step-by-step how different questions were investigated with a genomic epidemiological approach. Rather than providing the kinds of neat and cohesive narratives we frequently see in peer-reviewed literature, we have tried to show how hands-on investigations really proceed, including evaluating competing hypotheses and describing sources of uncertainty in our analyses. This chapter is pertinent to readers who will be directly involved in analyzing and interpreting genomic epidemiological studies, or who want to see examples of genomic epidemiology in practice. 6.1 Are cases of the same Variant of Concern lineage linked? At the beginning of 2021, public health authorities within the United States were concerned about the transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage (“Alpha” within the WHO nomenclature system), which appeared to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2. Already the dominantly-circulating lineage within the United Kingdom, public health agencies within the United States were interested in whether B.1.1.7 had already arrived in the United States, and if so, how it was distributed and at what frequency. Genomic surveillance activities were established and intensified to investigate these questions. Beyond estimating frequency, some public health agencies also monitored for individual cases infected with “Variant of Concern” lineages, which they might prioritize for more aggressive contact tracing and control efforts to limit the establishment and growth of VOC lineages within the jurisdiction. County A is a predominantly rural county, in which diagnostic testing and genomic surveillance are primarily handled by the local public health laboratory. The county started an in-house SARS-CoV-2 sequencing program at the beginning of 2021, and had regular sequencing and lineage assignment protocols in place during the spring of 2021, when they detected their first two cases of B.1.1.7 lineage-viruses among two residents of the county. The two cases were detected and sampled during the same week, a timeline that was consistent with one case infecting the other, resulting in an epidemiologically-linked pair. Beyond the timing of the two infections, epidemiological-linkage between the cases seemed possible since both cases were assigned the same lineage (B.1.1.7), and no other B.1.1.7 cases had been detected in County A up to this point. However, while Pango lineage assignments can provide a useful summary of different genetic lineages, most Pango lineages have genetic diversity within the lineage. Especially for lineages whose frequency grows significantly, such as B.1.1.7, there may be many different transmission chains of B.1.1.7 viruses circulating within different geographic areas. In such cases, phylogenetic analyses can provide higher resolution for refining relationships between cases. In response to these detections, County A undertook a rigorous analysis of the whole genome sequences from these two cases. Firstly, since these were the first B.1.1.7 cases detected in the county, County A wanted to verify the accuracy of the lineage calls. To do so, they looked at the .bam files, which show the actual sequencing read data mapped to a reference genome. To confirm the quality of the B.1.1.7 lineage defining SNP calls, they looked at the total number of reads that covered the lineage-defining site, and looked for the particular SNP call in each of the reads (Figure 5.1). This process was repeated for all B.1.1.7 defining sites. Figure 6.1: A zoomed in picture of site 23063 in the nucleotide sequence, where the reference sequence has an A and the sequencing reads show that this infection has a T at this site. The A23063T mutation in the nucleotide sequence corresponds to an N501Y substitution in Spike protein, which is one of multiple lineage defining mutations for B.1.1.7. At this site there are 390 distinct, high quality sequencing reads that support this call. Furthermore, both forward and reverse reads detect this nucleotide, further demonstrating that this call is real. Next, County A took the two confirmed B.1.1.7 lineage viruses and imported the sequences into Nextclade in order to assess their quality. The sequences showed minimal numbers of Ns, no mixed sites, and a reasonable number of mutations as compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (Figure 5.2). This indicates that the sequences are high quality, and appropriate for analysis. Notably, the sequences do have frameshift mutations in them, which is why the Nextclade F metric is red (Figure 5.2). While sometimes real, these frameshifts are often a bioinformatic artifact from the consensus genome assembly pipeline. While the author of a genome sequence will typically have to fix or document a frameshift for public repositories to accept the sequence, one can still use them in phylogenetic pipelines that “strip” these frameshifts away. Looking at the two sequences together in the Nextclade alignment viewer, we can see that both samples share some SNPs, as indicated by the colored bars (Figure 5.2). This makes sense since we know that both samples are B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. However, we can also see that there are differences between the two sequences as well (Figure 5.2). Each sample has numerous additional SNPs that are unique to the sample. This indicates that these samples are likely not directly related. The next paragraph will discuss that logic in more depth, and show how we can see that genetic divergence on the phylogenetic placement available in Nextclade. Figure 6.2: The two B.1.1.7 lineage viruses as visualized in Nextclade (sequence names are intentionally masked). Notably, all quality metrics show that the sequences are of high quality, except for the “F” metric, which indicates that a frameshift mutation has been detected. The sequence view shows that the two sequences share many SNPs, but also have some unique SNPs that are not found in the other sequence. In Nextclade we can take our two sequences and “graft” them onto a pre-inferred Nextstrain phylogeny in a process that is termed “phylogenetic placement”. The sequences are placed onto the tree according to the patterns of substitutions that the tree summarizes, and that your sequences have. The sequences of interest are placed onto the tree at the point where most of the SNPs in your genome sequence have also been observed in the tree. Then, any mutations that are unique to your sample, and not yet detected in the background tree, are shown as branch length leading from the tree to the sample of interest. In Figure 5.3A below, we can see that both sequences group in the Alpha lineage portion of the tree, consistent with their designation as B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. When we zoom in to the Alpha clade of the tree, we can see that despite both viruses receiving a B.1.1.7 assignment, they are quite diverged (Figure 5.3B). Indeed, these two B.1.1.7 sequences are separated by 13 SNPs (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3B). This is much more genetic divergence than we would expect to see if the sequences were epidemiologically-linked. Figure 6.3: A) Nextclade phylogenetic placement of the two B.1.1.7 sequences onto a background Nextstrain tree. Nextclade places both of these sequences on the tree within the Alpha clade, consistent with the Pango lineage assignments and our visual assessment of the sequencing reads. B) A zoomed in view of the two sequences within the Alpha lineage of the tree shows that they are placed onto different parts of the tree within the Alpha clade. You can count the number of nucleotides changes separating the two viruses by “walking the path” of the highlighted branches between the two samples, counting up the number of nucleotide changes observed on each segment of the path as you go. An important note is that the vertical axis has no meaning, thus you are only summing up the number of SNPs observed along the horizontal branches. For an in-depth discussion of different thresholds of divergence, please see “Why sequencing is better at dismissing links than confirming them” in the Fundamental Theory chapter. However, we can also do a back-of-the envelope calculation to provide some context about what a 13 SNP difference means. Firstly, we should note that the average evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is roughly 24.5 substitutions across the entire genome per year (see Figure 5.4). This means that if we were to randomly sample two sequences that were sampled a year apart from each other, we would expect them on average to be 24.5 SNPs different from each other. If you were looking at the actual divergence between two sequences, the SNP difference counts would be whole numbers, but this rate is the average value if you were to repeat that sampling procedure many times over. If we take our two samples from County A that are separated by 13 SNPs and think about what this distance means in light of the evolutionary rate of the virus, we can say that roughly 6 months worth of transmission separates these two infections. Figure 6.4: The clock view from the global SARS-CoV-2 Nextstrain build maintained by the Nextstrain team (available at https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global?l=clock). Each circle in this plot represents a sampled virus (a tip in the tree), and it’s position in the plot is determined by the date the virus was sampled and the number of SNPs that it has compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome. The evolutionary rate estimate comes from the slope of a least-squares line fit through the data points. What does this mean from a public health standpoint? County A can be confident that these two cases are not linked - the genome sequences are too diverged for that to be likely. Thus, these two cases of B.1.1.7 more likely represent independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the county. This means that these two cases do not represent a transmission event of B.1.1.7 within County A. Rather, these two cases were likely separately infected somewhere else outside the county, and then returned home where they were tested for COVID-19. At this point, case interviews could be helpful for discerning whether these cases recently traveled, or what exposure event may have led them to contract a lineage that had not previously been detected in County A. Furthermore, since these two cases do not represent sustained transmission within the county, aggressive contact tracing efforts might be warranted in order to prevent establishment of B.1.1.7 circulation in the county. 6.2 Evaluating an intake screening program to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to prisons. County C has a large jail housing a considerable number of pre-trial detainees. Given the challenge of controlling SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, including prisons, public health officials in County C implemented a screening system for COVID-19. The jail had experienced previous outbreaks, and the intent of this screening program was to prevent new introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the jail, which could seed further outbreaks. As part of the screening program, newly incarcerated individuals were tested for COVID-19 if they consented, and underwent a two week quarantine period prior to being moved into the standard housing units. The jail recorded cases across multiple residential pods. Given the duration of time over which cases were observed, and the fact that multiple residential pods appeared to be affected, epidemiologists were interested in what processes were contributing to COVID-19 cases within the jail. Was the intake quarantine program ineffective, in which case newly-admitted persons were introducing SARS-CoV-2 into the jail? Or had a previous outbreak within the jail never fully ended? Given the ability of pathogen genomic sequence data to differentiate between related and unrelated cases, investigators sequenced samples from cases who tested positive during their intake screening quarantine period, and from cases that were detected within the residential pods of the jail. Five sequences were collected from individuals who had tested positive during intake quarantine, and twenty-one sequences were collected from individuals who tested positive while residing in the jail. All of the sequences were assigned the same Pango lineage, thus the lineage information did not provide sufficient information to discern relationships between the samples. Therefore, investigators took these sequences and performed a phylogenetic analysis of jail sequences alongside contextual sequence data that had been collected from County C and other locales through representative surveillance sampling. The genetic divergence tree in Figure 5.5 below shows the clade grouping 26 sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals (jail sequences are in yellow, contextual data are in grey). Looking at that clade we can see a few important findings. Firstly, some of the jail sequences are genetically diverged, and are more closely related to contextual sequences sampled from the broader community than they are to other sequences collected from incarcerated individuals. Secondly, there is one clade in which samples from the jail have identical consensus genome sequences and sequences that are very closely related to each other. Knowing that genetically-similar infections are more likely to be linked to each other, and that genetically-dissimilar infections are likely unrelated, we can surmise from this tree that some of these cases likely constitute an outbreak, while other cases among incarcerated individuals represent community-acquired infections that are not part of the outbreak. Figure 6.5: Phylogenetic tree of jail sequences and representatively-sampled contextual sequences. A) The top panel of this figure shows the clade within which all jail sequences group with other contextual sequences. Contextual sequences are shown in grey while jail sequences are coloured yellow. In this view you can see the broad distribution of some jail sequences across the entire clade, as well as one cluster of jail sequences which appear closely genetically-related. B) A zoomed-in view of the clade which clusters many jail sequences together. Many of the jail sequences within this cluster have identical genome sequences, and therefore appear stacked vertically along the root node of the outbreak clade. We see other jail sequences within this cluster that appear to have one or two additional nucleotide mutations. Knowing that not all of these cases are genetically-related is the first step in evaluating the intake screening program. However, this information alone is not sufficient. What we really want to see is which of these 26 sequences come from cases detected during intake screening, and which cases come from incarcerated individuals living in the residential pods. To combine the genomic picture with this epidemiologic data, we can make use of the functionality in Nextstrain that allows us to overlay additional surveillance data onto a tree. In Figure 5.6 below, we’ve overlaid the phylogenetic tree with a tsv file that maps “case status” (either inmate or intake screening) to the “strain name” of the sequence in the Nextstrain tree. This allows us to then color the tree according to this new field. In the tree below, we can see that sequences from cases found during intake screening are colored in yellow, while cases detected within the jail are colored in blue. Figure 6.6: Metadata overlay onto Nextstrain phylogenetic tree differentiates sequences from incarcerated individuals (inmates) and from intake screening. On the left hand side of this figure is a screenshot of the metadata file formatted such that it can be dragged and dropped onto the tree. On the right, we see the same cluster as shown in Figure 5.5, but now jail sequences are coloured according to whether they were sampled from incarcerated individuals residing in pods (blue) or from individuals undergoing intake screening (yellow). Contextual sequences remain coloured in grey. This picture helps us understand the following. Firstly, cases detected through the intake screening program are not genetically-related to cases that were detected within the jail’s residential pods. This means that the observed transmission within the jail’s residential units was not initiated by any of the sequenced positive cases detected during intake screening. Secondly, intake cases are genetically similar to sequences sampled representatively from surrounding communities. This result supports a scenario in which newly admitted individuals were infected prior to their intake, with those infections discovered during the quarantine period. Thirdly, sequenced cases from intake screening are terminal tips in the tree. By that, we mean that there are no sequences in the tree that descend from infections detected during intake screening. This means that the quarantine period halted onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, within the clade grouping all sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals living in the residential pods, we see that twelve cases are infected with an identical genotype that is basal to other related genotypes detected among the incarcerated individuals residing in pods (Figure 5.7). Additional samples from incarcerated individuals show additional substitutions accrued on top of the basal genotype. While some of this diversity could represent the transmission of within-host diversity during a super-spreading event, it is also consistent with substitutions accruing over the course of multiple transmission events. The latter scenario, that the accrued genetic diversity is the result of ongoing circulation within the jail, is more likely given that the cases among incarcerated individuals were detected over multiple months. Figure 6.7: Phylogenetic tree showing the outbreak within the residential pods of the jail. Twelve sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals in the residential pods show identical genome sequences, and are the basal genotype of this clade. There are five contextual sequences that also have this identical genotype. Further investigation of which cases these contextual sequences were sampled from may provide some information regarding how this outbreak was introduced to the jail. Three sequences have an additional unique nucleotide mutation, and one sequence has an additional two nucleotide mutations that are unique to that sample. At the top of this clade we see an additional clade that groups 4 jail samples that all share one additional nucleotide mutation on top of the basal sequence. This pattern of unique and shared diversity, in conjunction with the timeframe over which these samples were collected, suggests ongoing circulation of this clade within the jail over time. In terms of public health policy, these findings indicate that the intake screening program is serving its intended effect, namely, preventing new introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the jail. While it is unclear how the outbreak was introduced into the prison, the most cases within the incarcerated population appear to be related to ongoing transmission within the jail, and thus interventions should focus on controlling transmission within the jail and its residential pods.
