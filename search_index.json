Currently there is a gap in the genomic epidemiology literature. There are excellent review papers providing short, accessible summaries of how pathogen genomics can support aims in public health (e.g. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1813907). On the other end of the spectrum are scientific papers describing technical methods and findings of genomic epidemiological studies of various pathogens. We felt that something was missing from the middle; an open resource that introduced the basic theory and utility of genomic epidemiology in public health practice, and provided step-by-step guidance for investigating common questions. To this end, we have strived to create a resource that will help readers: Understand how genomic epidemiology can support certain investigations, Implement genomic surveillance systems, and Apply genomic epidemiology to routine investigations in public health practice. 1.2 What this handbook is not. This resource is not a review of the primary literature in genomic epidemiology, nor do we aim to provide an exhaustive description of all the questions that scientists can investigate with genomic epidemiology. We will not present every method for genomic epidemiological analysis, nor will we provide information on the entire suite of available analytic tools. Rather, this handbook is meant as a practical guide to applied genomic epidemiology. As such, we focus on the questions that we have seen public health practitioners encounter most frequently, and present analytical methods and tools that are easily used within public health departments and other applied epidemiology settings. 1.3 Who is this handbook written for? We have designed this handbook to support the use of genomic epidemiology in public health decision making and outbreak response. This book is for you if you are already involved in, or want to develop a program for, genomic data collection, genomic data analysis, genomic data interpretation, and/or policy evaluation in public health. For example: Public health microbiologists or lab directors developing a genomic surveillance program. Bioinformaticians working in public health, and wanting to increase their familiarity with the goals, theory, and approaches specific to genomic epidemiology. Epidemiologists who typically work with surveillance data, but who want to integrate molecular information as well. Health officers or other policy makers who want to understand more about pathogen genomic data as a source of epidemiological information. Academics collaborating with a public health institution who want to learn more about genomic epidemiology in applied public health settings. 1.4 How should you read this handbook? You can think of this resource as funnel-shaped, moving from imperative concepts that all readers should find useful towards more specific implementation information that is most pertinent for those readers specifically involved in data collection and analysis. We recommend that all readers read the first two chapters introducing the utility of pathogen genomics in public health and the fundamental theory underlying genomic epidemiology. These two sections will help you understand how genomic data enrich public health investigations and the basic mechanics behind genomic epidemiology. These sections will also help to introduce common language for discussing phylogenetic trees. Readers involved in designing or implementing genomic surveillance and epidemiology programs within their agencies should also read the sections on sampling strategy and broad use cases for genomic epidemiology. These sections will help outline in more detail how to approach data collection and analysis for common topical areas and questions we see public health departments seeking to investigate with genomic epidemiological approaches. From there, readers who wish to see investigations falling under these different use cases in action should read the “Case studies” section. Our intent with the case studies is to show step-by-step why we initiated an investigation, how we framed our question of interest, and how we investigated it, including quality control, evaluating competing hypotheses, and weighing uncertainty. While narratives presented in the published literature are by design cohesive and smooth, with these case studies, we aim to show exactly how an investigation occurred, including bumps and questions along the way. Finally, we have a section on “Tools and methods”, which lives towards the end of this handbook since it is primarily pertinent to those readers actively involved in genomic epidemiological analysis. "],["the-value-of-pathogen-genomics-in-applied-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response.", " Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology Have you ever wondered “What would be the benefit of having genomic surveillance capacity?” This chapter attempts to answer that question. In the following chapter we describe the utility of pathogen genomic data for public health surveillance and for outbreak response. We have distinguished between surveillance and outbreak response use cases for two reasons. Firstly, the turnaround times for which genomic data retain utility are different for surveillance versus outbreak response. Typically, outbreak response requires sequencing and genomic analysis to occur more rapidly. Secondly, the sampling frames that you would use for surveillance are different from what you would use for outbreak response. We will elaborate on sampling frames in Chapter 4 of this resource. Finally, we recognize that getting a genomic epidemiology program up and running can be slow and challenging. We therefore discuss how genomic data can remain useful even when they are not available in real time. This chapter should be pertinent to most readers, since it provides a broad rationale for why genomic surveillance and genomic epidemiology help support applied epidemiology activities. 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. Genomic data provide additional resolution to determine relationships between cases. From a surveillance standpoint, this ability to delineate clusters of related cases more sensitively allows public health practitioners to see separate pathogen lineages circulating within a particular area of interest. This capacity allows the epidemiologist to see distinct chains of transmission even when they circulate in a population concurrently, a finding that can be challenging to see in case surveillance data alone. What is the benefit of detecting these distinct transmission chains? Firstly, this additional layer of resolution enables the public health practitioner to detect the emergence or introduction of new lineages into their community or surveillance area, and distinguish introduction events from endemic transmission within the surveillance area. Developing a more precise understanding of how the processes of introduction and endemic transmission drive incidence within your area allows public health authorities to intervene in more precise and tailored ways. For example, if most cases within the surveillance area result from multiple introductions of distinct lineages that transmit only minimally within the surveillance area, then policies that seek to reduce the introduction of disease from other areas are likely to be more effective in reducing case counts. In contrast, if most cases are attributable to a single circulating transmission chain within the surveillance area, then public health policies focusing on reducing travel-acquired cases are likely to be less effective, and greater focus should be oriented towards public health interventions designed to interrupt transmission within the community. Figure 1: Epi curves with sequences Beyond simply detecting distinct transmission chains, genomic surveillance data can enable the epidemiologist to see how different clusters contribute to the overall picture of transmission. For example, perhaps you detect four circulating genotypes within your community. Despite the existence of these four transmission chains, the majority of the cases in your community can be attributed to the circulation of just one of those transmission chains. In this case, the public health practitioner can focus attention on understanding what risk factors or demographic profiles appear most associated with the primary circulating transmission chain, with the hope that a more detailed understanding of that particular transmission chain will underscore more tailored and effective interventions. Furthermore, evaluating the contribution of different pathogen genotypes to case counts over time can provide more precise situational awareness about how different variables shape the epidemiology of a pathogen. For example, we may be concerned about how travel and holiday behavior contribute to cross-border pathogen spread. Genomic surveillance data can enable us to investigate that question, monitoring the prevalence of particular genotypes in different countries and observing changes in genotype-specific incidence rates following major travel periods. Such analyses enabled epidemiologists to monitor the rise of the 20E lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Europe during the summer of 2020, attributing the rising dominance of the variant to holiday travel, rather than to increased viral fitness or transmissibility (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03677-y). However, sometimes more fit lineages of a pathogen do emerge; here again genomic surveillance data can provide fast situational awareness. By monitoring genotype-specific incidence rates, we are well poised to detect an acceleration in transmission of a particular lineage. Enabled with high-resolution descriptive epidemiological information, we can follow up with analytical epidemiological studies to test hypotheses about why a particular strain is rising in frequency. This exact process was critical to detecting the emergence of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) in the United Kingdom, and attributing the rise in frequency to the actual increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03470-x)(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg3055) Finally, a change in commonly-reported symptoms or illness severity associated with an increase in a particular genotype could indicate a change in the clinical presentation of illness, possibly associated with a genotypic change in the pathogen. Figure 2: Frequency changes by strain 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. Pathogen genome sequences can help us detect or rule out linkages between cases. Similarly to how specific case definitions improve the sensitivity of traditional epidemiologic study designs, genomic data can support outbreak response by improving one’s ability to accurately classify which cases form an outbreak cluster. Below are some toy examples to clarify how this works, and to demonstrate how this information is useful in guiding public health practice. In this first toy example, imagine that three skilled nursing facilities in your community are all experiencing outbreaks of a particular illness. As spaces of congregate living, typically housing more vulnerable people, such facilities may be more prone to higher incidence of disease. Thus you may ask yourself, are the outbreaks I see in these three facilities independent outbreaks, attributable simply to the higher risk setting? Or might these outbreaks actually be linked? Furthermore, are all of the cases detected within the facilities linked? Or do some cases form a cluster, while others have simply been detected due to enhanced screening? Figure 3 below shows how genomic data can help elucidate some of these possibilities. From the surveillance data we can see that we have cases detected across all three SNFs. When we sequence the viruses from those infections, an interesting picture unfolds. Each SNF has a subset of cases with closely related genome-sequences (indicated here by colour). Each SNF also has cases whose genome sequences are distinct from each other and from the related infections found across all of the SNFs. This theoretical picture helps us understand a few things. Firstly, these are not three independent outbreaks, but rather one outbreak across three facilities. This may cause us to ask are residents transferred between facilities regularly? Do staff members work at multiple facilities? How can we limit inter-facility transmission? Secondly, not all of the cases that were detected across the SNFs are related to the outbreak. Rather, we have one primary cluster. Additionally, we have detected other cases of the disease that were likely acquired in the community, separately from the outbreak. Figure 3: Linking cases with genomic data Similarly, genomic data can distinguish cases that are not linked, even if they are detected within the same setting or facility, or infect individuals with similar demographic profiles. Distinguishing between unrelated and related cases within a single setting can enable epidemiologists to more clearly see what precise factor is leading to transmission. Let us take another toy example, in this case a factory where you detected an elevated incidence of disease above baseline. The cases are distributed across the factory, among both managerial staff who primarily work in offices and individuals working in assembling products. All the cases have been detected around the same time period, meaning that temporal pattern supports a single outbreak across the entire facility. In that case, what factor is facilitating transmission? How will you act in order to interrupt transmission? Figure 4 below shows how the addition of genomic data enables you to see that the cases among office-based managerial staff are unrelated to the cases occurring on the assembly line. While all cases occurred among employees of the factory, infections among managerial staff are genetically distinct from cases that occurred among assembly staff. Therefore, managerial infections appear to have been acquired externally from the workplace. In contrast, all cases among assembly staff are genetically related. Distinguishing the office staff cases from the case assembly staff cases allows you to see that any transmission occurring within the factory appears to be specific to the assembly area of the factory. This improves the sensitivity with which you can detect the factors or behaviors that are facilitating transmission, and hopefully making it easier to intervene. Figure 4: Distinguishing cases with genomic data "],["fundamental-theory-in-genomic-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 3 Fundamental theory in genomic epidemiology", " Chapter 3 Fundamental theory in genomic epidemiology One of the strengths of incorporating genomic data into epidemiological investigations is that it provides an additional, independent data stream by which to assess infectious disease dynamics. One of the challenges that comes hand-in-hand with that strength is that genomic epidemiology uses theory, analytical approaches, and jargon that surveillance epidemiologists may not be familiar with. In this Chapter we introduce the fundamental theory that underlies genomic epidemiological analysis and describe the terminology that genomic epidemiologists frequently use in describing and interpreting our analyses. This chapter, which summarizes the principles and mechanics of genomic epidemiology, should be pertinent to most readers of this handbook. #Sampling strategies In this Chapter we describe two major approaches to sample selection for genomic epidemiological studies. We describe when you should use these different sampling strategies, focusing on which types of questions you may be interested in, and how the particular sampling strategy supports the goal of your investigation. This Chapter is pertinent for any readers who are actively seeking to implement genomic surveillance programs and integrate genomic epidemiology into their public health investigations. Readers who want to understand why different sampling strategies are useful will also benefit from reading these sections. "],["broad-use-cases-for-genomic-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 4 Broad use cases for genomic epidemiology", " Chapter 4 Broad use cases for genomic epidemiology In this Chapter we describe thematic areas of genomic epidemiological analysis for public health investigations. For each of these areas, we provide more concrete examples of the types of questions that fall within these topical areas, the fundamental theoretical principles that you will draw upon to investigate those questions, and different sampling methods and analysis methods for investigating those types of questions. This Chapter is pertinent to readers who seeking a concrete description of when to use genomic epidemiological analysis and how to conduct different types of studies and analyses. "],["case-studies.html", "Chapter 5 Case studies 5.1 Are cases of the same Variant of Concern lineage linked?", " Chapter 5 Case studies In this Chapter, we provide case studies exemplifying how the broad thematic areas of genomic epidemiological analysis described in Chapter 5 can manifest in practice. These case studies illustrate step-by-step how different questions were investigated with a genomic epidemiological approach. Rather than providing the kinds of neat and cohesive narratives we frequently see in peer-reviewed literature, we have tried to show how hands-on investigations really proceed, including evaluating competing hypotheses and describing sources of uncertainty in our analyses. This chapter is pertinent to readers who will be directly involved in analyzing and interpreting genomic epidemiological studies, or who want to see examples of genomic epidemiology in practice. 5.1 Are cases of the same Variant of Concern lineage linked? At the beginning of 2021, public health authorities within the United States were concerned about the transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage (“Alpha” within the WHO nomenclature system), which appeared to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2. Already the dominantly-circulating lineage within the United Kingdom, public health agencies within the United States were interested in whether B.1.1.7 had already arrived in the United States, and if so, how it was distributed and at what frequency. Genomic surveillance activities were established and intensified to investigate these questions. Beyond estimating frequency, some public health agencies also monitored for individual cases infected with “Variant of Concern” lineages, which they might prioritize for more aggressive contact tracing and control efforts to limit the establishment and growth of VOC lineages within the jurisdiction. County A is a predominantly rural county, in which diagnostic testing and genomic surveillance are primarily handled by the local public health laboratory. The county started an in-house SARS-CoV-2 sequencing program at the beginning of 2021, and had regular sequencing and lineage assignment protocols in place during the spring of 2021, when they detected their first two cases of B.1.1.7 lineage-viruses among two residents of the county. The two cases were detected and sampled during the same week, a timeline that was consistent with one case infecting the other, resulting in an epidemiologically-linked pair. Beyond the timing of the two infections, epidemiological-linkage between the cases seemed possible since both cases were assigned the same lineage (B.1.1.7), and no other B.1.1.7 cases had been detected in County A up to this point. However, while Pango lineage assignments can provide a useful summary of different genetic lineages, most Pango lineages have genetic diversity within the lineage. Especially for lineages whose frequency grows significantly, such as B.1.1.7, there may be many different transmission chains of B.1.1.7 viruses circulating within different geographic areas. In such cases, phylogenetic analyses can provide higher resolution for refining relationships between cases. In response to these detections, County A undertook a rigorous analysis of the whole genome sequences from these two cases. Firstly, since these were the first B.1.1.7 cases detected in the county, County A wanted to verify the accuracy of the lineage calls. To do so, they looked at the .bam files, which show the actual sequencing read data mapped to a reference genome. To confirm the quality of the B.1.1.7 lineage defining SNP calls, they looked at the total number of reads that covered the lineage-defining site, and looked for the particular SNP call in each of the reads (Figure 5.1). This process was repeated for all B.1.1.7 defining sites. Figure 5.1: A zoomed in picture of site 23063 in the nucleotide sequence, where the reference sequence has an A and the sequencing reads show that this infection has a T at this site. The A23063T mutation in the nucleotide sequence corresponds to an N501Y substitution in Spike protein, which is one of multiple lineage defining mutations for B.1.1.7. At this site there are 390 distinct, high quality sequencing reads that support this call. Furthermore, both forward and reverse reads detect this nucleotide, further demonstrating that this call is real. Next, County A took the two confirmed B.1.1.7 lineage viruses and imported the sequences into Nextclade in order to assess their quality. The sequences showed minimal numbers of Ns, no mixed sites, and a reasonable number of mutations as compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (Figure 5.2). This indicates that the sequences are high quality, and appropriate for analysis. Notably, the sequences do have frameshift mutations in them, which is why the Nextclade F metric is red (Figure 5.2). While sometimes real, these frameshifts are often a bioinformatic artifact from the consensus genome assembly pipeline. While the author of a genome sequence will typically have to fix or document a frameshift for public repositories to accept the sequence, one can still use them in phylogenetic pipelines that “strip” these frameshifts away. Looking at the two sequences together in the Nextclade alignment viewer, we can see that both samples share some SNPs, as indicated by the colored bars (Figure 5.2). This makes sense since we know that both samples are B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. However, we can also see that there are differences between the two sequences as well (Figure 5.2). Each sample has numerous additional SNPs that are unique to the sample. This indicates that these samples are likely not directly related. The next paragraph will discuss that logic in more depth, and show how we can see that genetic divergence on the phylogenetic placement available in Nextclade. Figure 5.2: The two B.1.1.7 lineage viruses as visualized in Nextclade (sequence names are intentionally masked). Notably, all quality metrics show that the sequences are of high quality, except for the “F” metric, which indicates that a frameshift mutation has been detected. The sequence view shows that the two sequences share many SNPs, but also have some unique SNPs that are not found in the other sequence. In Nextclade we can take our two sequences and “graft” them onto a pre-inferred Nextstrain phylogeny in a process that is termed “phylogenetic placement”. The sequences are placed onto the tree according to the patterns of substitutions that the tree summarizes, and that your sequences have. The sequences of interest are placed onto the tree at the point where most of the SNPs in your genome sequence have also been observed in the tree. Then, any mutations that are unique to your sample, and not yet detected in the background tree, are shown as branch length leading from the tree to the sample of interest. In Figure 5.3A below, we can see that both sequences group in the Alpha lineage portion of the tree, consistent with their designation as B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. When we zoom in to the Alpha clade of the tree, we can see that despite both viruses receiving a B.1.1.7 assignment, they are quite diverged (Figure 5.3B). Indeed, these two B.1.1.7 sequences are separated by 13 SNPs (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3B). This is much more genetic divergence than we would expect to see if the sequences were epidemiologically-linked. Figure 5.3: A) Nextclade phylogenetic placement of the two B.1.1.7 sequences onto a background Nextstrain tree. Nextclade places both of these sequences on the tree within the Alpha clade, consistent with the Pango lineage assignments and our visual assessment of the sequencing reads. B) A zoomed in view of the two sequences within the Alpha lineage of the tree shows that they are placed onto different parts of the tree within the Alpha clade. You can count the number of nucleotides changes separating the two viruses by “walking the path” of the highlighted branches between the two samples, counting up the number of nucleotide changes observed on each segment of the path as you go. An important note is that the vertical axis has no meaning, thus you are only summing up the number of SNPs observed along the horizontal branches. For an in-depth discussion of different thresholds of divergence, please see “Why sequencing is better at dismissing links than confirming them” in the Fundamental Theory chapter. However, we can also do a back-of-the envelope calculation to provide some context about what a 13 SNP difference means. Firstly, we should note that the average evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is roughly 24.5 substitutions across the entire genome per year (see Figure 5.4). This means that if we were to randomly sample two sequences that were sampled a year apart from each other, we would expect them on average to be 24.5 SNPs different from each other. If you were looking at the actual divergence between two sequences, the SNP difference counts would be whole numbers, but this rate is the average value if you were to repeat that sampling procedure many times over. If we take our two samples from County A that are separated by 13 SNPs and think about what this distance means in light of the evolutionary rate of the virus, we can say that roughly 6 months worth of transmission separates these two infections. Figure 5.4: The clock view from the global SARS-CoV-2 Nextstrain build maintained by the Nextstrain team (available at https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global?l=clock). Each circle in this plot represents a sampled virus (a tip in the tree), and it’s position in the plot is determined by the date the virus was sampled and the number of SNPs that it has compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome. The evolutionary rate estimate comes from the slope of a least-squares line fit through the data points. What does this mean from a public health standpoint? County A can be confident that these two cases are not linked - the genome sequences are too diverged for that to be likely. Thus, these two cases of B.1.1.7 more likely represent independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the county. This means that these two cases do not represent a transmission event of B.1.1.7 within County A. Rather, these two cases were likely separately infected somewhere else outside the county, and then returned home where they were tested for COVID-19. At this point, case interviews could be helpful for discerning whether these cases recently traveled, or what exposure event may have led them to contract a lineage that had not previously been detected in County A. Furthermore, since these two cases do not represent sustained transmission within the county, aggressive contact tracing efforts might be warranted in order to prevent establishment of B.1.1.7 circulation in the county.
