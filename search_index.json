Currently there is a gap in the genomic epidemiology literature. There are excellent review papers providing short, accessible summaries of how pathogen genomics can support aims in public health (e.g. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1813907). On the other end of the spectrum are scientific papers describing technical methods and findings of genomic epidemiological studies of various pathogens. We felt that something was missing from the middle; an open resource that introduced the basic theory and utility of genomic epidemiology in public health practice, and provided step-by-step guidance for investigating common questions. To this end, we have strived to create a resource that will help readers: Understand how genomic epidemiology can support certain investigations, Implement genomic surveillance systems, and Apply genomic epidemiology to routine investigations in public health practice. 1.2 What this handbook is not. This resource is not a review of the primary literature in genomic epidemiology, nor do we aim to provide an exhaustive description of all the questions that scientists can investigate with genomic epidemiology. We will not present every method for genomic epidemiological analysis, nor will we provide information on the entire suite of available analytic tools. Rather, this handbook is meant as a practical guide to applied genomic epidemiology. As such, we focus on the questions that we have seen public health practitioners encounter most frequently, and present analytical methods and tools that are easily used within public health departments and other applied epidemiology settings. 1.3 Who is this handbook written for? We have designed this handbook to support the use of genomic epidemiology in public health decision making and outbreak response. This book is for you if you are already involved in, or want to develop a program for, genomic data collection, genomic data analysis, genomic data interpretation, and/or policy evaluation in public health. For example: Public health microbiologists or lab directors developing a genomic surveillance program. Bioinformaticians working in public health, and wanting to increase their familiarity with the goals, theory, and approaches specific to genomic epidemiology. Epidemiologists who typically work with surveillance data, but who want to integrate molecular information as well. Health officers or other policy makers who want to understand more about pathogen genomic data as a source of epidemiological information. Academics collaborating with a public health institution who want to learn more about genomic epidemiology in applied public health settings. 1.4 How should you read this handbook? You can think of this resource as funnel-shaped, moving from imperative concepts that all readers should find useful towards more specific implementation information that is most pertinent for those readers specifically involved in data collection and analysis. We recommend that all readers read the first two chapters introducing the utility of pathogen genomics in public health and the fundamental theory underlying genomic epidemiology. These two sections will help you understand how genomic data enrich public health investigations and the basic mechanics behind genomic epidemiology. These sections will also help to introduce common language for discussing phylogenetic trees. Readers involved in designing or implementing genomic surveillance and epidemiology programs within their agencies should also read the sections on sampling strategy and broad use cases for genomic epidemiology. These sections will help outline in more detail how to approach data collection and analysis for common topical areas and questions we see public health departments seeking to investigate with genomic epidemiological approaches. From there, readers who wish to see investigations falling under these different use cases in action should read the “Case studies” section. Our intent with the case studies is to show step-by-step why we initiated an investigation, how we framed our question of interest, and how we investigated it, including quality control, evaluating competing hypotheses, and weighing uncertainty. While narratives presented in the published literature are by design cohesive and smooth, with these case studies, we aim to show exactly how an investigation occurred, including bumps and questions along the way. Finally, we have a section on “Tools and methods”, which lives towards the end of this handbook since it is primarily pertinent to those readers actively involved in genomic epidemiological analysis.

In the following chapter we describe the utility of pathogen genomic data for public health surveillance and for outbreak response. We have distinguished between surveillance and outbreak response use cases for two reasons. Firstly, the turnaround times for which genomic data retain utility are different for surveillance versus outbreak response. Typically, outbreak response requires sequencing and genomic analysis to occur more rapidly. Secondly, the sampling frames that you would use for surveillance are different from what you would use for outbreak response. We will elaborate on sampling frames in Chapter 4 of this resource. Finally, we recognize that getting a genomic epidemiology program up and running can be slow and challenging. We therefore discuss how genomic data can remain useful even when they are not available in real time. This chapter should be pertinent to most readers, since it provides a broad rationale for why genomic surveillance and genomic epidemiology help support applied epidemiology activities. 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. Genomic data provide additional resolution to determine relationships between cases. From a surveillance standpoint, this ability to delineate clusters of related cases more sensitively allows public health practitioners to see separate pathogen lineages circulating within a particular area of interest. This capacity allows the epidemiologist to see distinct chains of transmission even when they circulate in a population concurrently, a finding that can be challenging to see in case surveillance data alone. What is the benefit of detecting these distinct transmission chains? Firstly, this additional layer of resolution enables the public health practitioner to detect the emergence or introduction of new lineages into their community or surveillance area, and distinguish introduction events from endemic transmission within the surveillance area. Developing a more precise understanding of how the processes of introduction and endemic transmission drive incidence within your area allows public health authorities to intervene in more precise and tailored ways. For example, if most cases within the surveillance area result from multiple introductions of distinct lineages that transmit only minimally within the surveillance area, then policies that seek to reduce the introduction of disease from other areas are likely to be more effective in reducing case counts. In contrast, if most cases are attributable to a single circulating transmission chain within the surveillance area, then public health policies focusing on reducing travel-acquired cases are likely to be less effective, and greater focus should be oriented towards public health interventions designed to interrupt transmission within the community. Figure 1: Epi curves with sequences Beyond simply detecting distinct transmission chains, genomic surveillance data can enable the epidemiologist to see how different clusters contribute to the overall picture of transmission. For example, perhaps you detect four circulating genotypes within your community. Despite the existence of these four transmission chains, the majority of the cases in your community can be attributed to the circulation of just one of those transmission chains. In this case, the public health practitioner can focus attention on understanding what risk factors or demographic profiles appear most associated with the primary circulating transmission chain, with the hope that a more detailed understanding of that particular transmission chain will underscore more tailored and effective interventions. Furthermore, evaluating the contribution of different pathogen genotypes to case counts over time can provide more precise situational awareness about how different variables shape the epidemiology of a pathogen. For example, we may be concerned about how travel and holiday behavior contribute to cross-border pathogen spread. Genomic surveillance data can enable us to investigate that question, monitoring the prevalence of particular genotypes in different countries and observing changes in genotype-specific incidence rates following major travel periods. Such analyses enabled epidemiologists to monitor the rise of the 20E lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Europe during the summer of 2020, attributing the rising dominance of the variant to holiday travel, rather than to increased viral fitness or transmissibility (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03677-y). However, sometimes more fit lineages of a pathogen do emerge; here again genomic surveillance data can provide fast situational awareness. By monitoring genotype-specific incidence rates, we are well poised to detect an acceleration in transmission of a particular lineage. Enabled with high-resolution descriptive epidemiological information, we can follow up with analytical epidemiological studies to test hypotheses about why a particular strain is rising in frequency. This exact process was critical to detecting the emergence of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) in the United Kingdom, and attributing the rise in frequency to the actual increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03470-x)(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg3055) Finally, a change in commonly-reported symptoms or illness severity associated with an increase in a particular genotype could indicate a change in the clinical presentation of illness, possibly associated with a genotypic change in the pathogen. Figure 2: Frequency changes by strain 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. Pathogen genome sequences can help us detect or rule out linkages between cases. Similarly to how specific case definitions improve the sensitivity of traditional epidemiologic study designs, genomic data can support outbreak response by improving one’s ability to accurately classify which cases form an outbreak cluster. Below are some toy examples to clarify how this works, and to demonstrate how this information is useful in guiding public health practice. In this first toy example, imagine that three skilled nursing facilities in your community are all experiencing outbreaks of a particular illness. As spaces of congregate living, typically housing more vulnerable people, such facilities may be more prone to higher incidence of disease. Thus you may ask yourself, are the outbreaks I see in these three facilities independent outbreaks, attributable simply to the higher risk setting? Or might these outbreaks actually be linked? Furthermore, are all of the cases detected within the facilities linked? Or do some cases form a cluster, while others have simply been detected due to enhanced screening? Figure 3 below shows how genomic data can help elucidate some of these possibilities. From the surveillance data we can see that we have cases detected across all three SNFs. When we sequence the viruses from those infections, an interesting picture unfolds. Each SNF has a subset of cases with closely related genome-sequences (indicated here by colour). Each SNF also has cases whose genome sequences are distinct from each other and from the related infections found across all of the SNFs. This theoretical picture helps us understand a few things. Firstly, these are not three independent outbreaks, but rather one outbreak across three facilities. This may cause us to ask are residents transferred between facilities regularly? Do staff members work at multiple facilities? How can we limit inter-facility transmission? Secondly, not all of the cases that were detected across the SNFs are related to the outbreak. Rather, we have one primary cluster. Additionally, we have detected other cases of the disease that were likely acquired in the community, separately from the outbreak. Figure 3: Linking cases with genomic data Similarly, genomic data can distinguish cases that are not linked, even if they are detected within the same setting or facility, or infect individuals with similar demographic profiles. Distinguishing between unrelated and related cases within a single setting can enable epidemiologists to more clearly see what precise factor is leading to transmission. Let us take another toy example, in this case a factory where you detected an elevated incidence of disease above baseline. The cases are distributed across the factory, among both managerial staff who primarily work in offices and individuals working in assembling products. All the cases have been detected around the same time period, meaning that temporal pattern supports a single outbreak across the entire facility. In that case, what factor is facilitating transmission? How will you act in order to interrupt transmission? Figure 4 below shows how the addition of genomic data enables you to see that the cases among office-based managerial staff are unrelated to the cases occurring on the assembly line. While all cases occurred among employees of the factory, infections among managerial staff are genetically distinct from cases that occurred among assembly staff. Therefore, managerial infections appear to have been acquired externally from the workplace. In contrast, all cases among assembly staff are genetically related. Distinguishing the office staff cases from the case assembly staff cases allows you to see that any transmission occurring within the factory appears to be specific to the assembly area of the factory. This improves the sensitivity with which you can detect the factors or behaviors that are facilitating transmission, and hopefully making it easier to intervene.
