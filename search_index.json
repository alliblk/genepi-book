Allison Black, Gytis Dudas, Patrick Ayscue 2022-01-23 Chapter 1 An introduction to this resource 1.1 What is this handbook? Currently there is a gap in the genomic epidemiology literature. There are excellent review papers providing short, accessible summaries of how pathogen genomics can support aims in public health (e.g. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1813907). On the other end of the spectrum are scientific papers describing technical methods and findings of genomic epidemiological studies of various pathogens. We felt that something was missing from the middle; an open resource that introduced the basic theory and utility of genomic epidemiology in public health practice, and provided step-by-step guidance for investigating common questions. To this end, we have strived to create a resource that will help readers: Understand how genomic epidemiology can support certain investigations, Implement genomic surveillance systems, and Apply genomic epidemiology to routine investigations in public health practice. 1.2 What this handbook is not. This resource is not a review of the primary literature in genomic epidemiology, nor do we aim to provide an exhaustive description of all the questions that scientists can investigate with genomic epidemiology. We will not present every method for genomic epidemiological analysis, nor will we provide information on the entire suite of available analytic tools. Rather, this handbook is meant as a practical guide to applied genomic epidemiology. As such, we focus on the questions that we have seen public health practitioners encounter most frequently, and present analytical methods and tools that are easily used within public health departments and other applied epidemiology settings. 1.3 Who is this handbook written for? We have designed this handbook to support the use of genomic epidemiology in public health decision making and outbreak response. This book is for you if you are already involved in, or want to develop a program for, genomic data collection, genomic data analysis, genomic data interpretation, and/or policy evaluation in public health. For example: Public health microbiologists or lab directors developing a genomic surveillance program. Bioinformaticians working in public health, and wanting to increase their familiarity with the goals, theory, and approaches specific to genomic epidemiology. Epidemiologists who typically work with surveillance data, but who want to integrate molecular information as well. Health officers or other policy makers who want to understand more about pathogen genomic data as a source of epidemiological information. Academics collaborating with a public health institution who want to learn more about genomic epidemiology in applied public health settings. 1.4 How should you read this handbook? You can think of this resource as funnel-shaped, moving from imperative concepts that all readers should find useful towards more specific implementation information that is most pertinent for those readers specifically involved in data collection and analysis. We recommend that all readers read the first two chapters introducing the utility of pathogen genomics in public health and the fundamental theory underlying genomic epidemiology. These two sections will help you understand how genomic data enrich public health investigations and the basic mechanics behind genomic epidemiology. These sections will also help to introduce common language for discussing phylogenetic trees. Readers involved in designing or implementing genomic surveillance and epidemiology programs within their agencies should also read the sections on sampling strategy and broad use cases for genomic epidemiology. These sections will help outline in more detail how to approach data collection and analysis for common topical areas and questions we see public health departments seeking to investigate with genomic epidemiological approaches. From there, readers who wish to see investigations falling under these different use cases in action should read the “Case studies” section. Our intent with the case studies is to show step-by-step why we initiated an investigation, how we framed our question of interest, and how we investigated it, including quality control, evaluating competing hypotheses, and weighing uncertainty. While narratives presented in the published literature are by design cohesive and smooth, with these case studies, we aim to show exactly how an investigation occurred, including bumps and questions along the way. Finally, we have a section on “Tools and methods”, which lives towards the end of this handbook since it is primarily pertinent to those readers actively involved in genomic epidemiological analysis. "],["the-value-of-pathogen-genomics-in-applied-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. 2.3 The value of retrospective data", " Chapter 2 The value of pathogen genomics in applied epidemiology Have you ever wondered “What would be the benefit of having genomic surveillance capacity?” This chapter attempts to answer that question. In the following chapter we describe the utility of pathogen genomic data for public health surveillance and for outbreak response. We have distinguished between surveillance and outbreak response use cases for two reasons. Firstly, the turnaround times for which genomic data retain utility are different for surveillance versus outbreak response. Typically, outbreak response requires sequencing and genomic analysis to occur more rapidly. Secondly, the sampling frames that you would use for surveillance are different from what you would use for outbreak response. We will elaborate on sampling frames in Chapter 4 of this resource. Finally, we recognize that getting a genomic epidemiology program up and running can be slow and challenging. We therefore discuss how genomic data can remain useful even when they are not available in real time. This chapter should be pertinent to most readers, since it provides a broad rationale for why genomic surveillance and genomic epidemiology help support applied epidemiology activities. 2.1 The value of genomic epidemiology for surveillance. Genomic data provide additional resolution to determine relationships between cases. From a surveillance standpoint, this ability to delineate clusters of related cases more sensitively allows public health practitioners to see separate pathogen lineages circulating within a particular area of interest. This capacity allows the epidemiologist to see distinct chains of transmission even when they circulate in a population concurrently, a finding that can be challenging to see in case surveillance data alone. What is the benefit of detecting these distinct transmission chains? Firstly, this additional layer of resolution enables the public health practitioner to detect the emergence or introduction of new lineages into their community or surveillance area, and distinguish introduction events from endemic transmission within the surveillance area. Developing a more precise understanding of how the processes of introduction and endemic transmission drive incidence within your area allows public health authorities to intervene in more precise and tailored ways. For example, if most cases within the surveillance area result from multiple introductions of distinct lineages that transmit only minimally within the surveillance area, then policies that seek to reduce the introduction of disease from other areas are likely to be more effective in reducing case counts. In contrast, if most cases are attributable to a single circulating transmission chain within the surveillance area, then public health policies focusing on reducing travel-acquired cases are likely to be less effective, and greater focus should be oriented towards public health interventions designed to interrupt transmission within the community. Figure 2.1: Epidemiologic curves without and with the addition of genomic data. On the left we see the epi curve without genomic information. Given just the shape of the curve, we might infer that this outbreak started from a single introduction event with some degree of sustained transmission. On the right we see the same epi curve, but with cases coloured according to their genotype. The addition of genomic data suggests that in fact this outbreak is attributable to three distinct introduction events of divergent genotypes, and that these different genotypes contributed in different degrees to the overall outbreak. Beyond simply detecting distinct transmission chains, genomic surveillance data can enable the epidemiologist to see how different clusters contribute to the overall picture of transmission. For example, perhaps you detect four circulating genotypes within your community. Despite the existence of these four transmission chains, the majority of the cases in your community can be attributed to the circulation of just one of those transmission chains. In this case, the public health practitioner can focus attention on understanding what risk factors or demographic profiles appear most associated with the primary circulating transmission chain, with the hope that a more detailed understanding of that particular transmission chain will underscore more tailored and effective interventions. Furthermore, evaluating the contribution of different pathogen genotypes to case counts over time can provide more precise situational awareness about how different variables shape the epidemiology of a pathogen. For example, we may be concerned about how travel and holiday behavior contribute to cross-border pathogen spread. Genomic surveillance data can enable us to investigate that question, monitoring the prevalence of particular genotypes in different countries and observing changes in genotype-specific incidence rates following major travel periods. Such analyses enabled epidemiologists to monitor the rise of the 20E lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Europe during the summer of 2020, attributing the rising dominance of the variant to holiday travel, rather than to increased viral fitness or transmissibility (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03677-y). However, sometimes more fit lineages of a pathogen do emerge; here again genomic surveillance data can provide fast situational awareness. By monitoring genotype-specific incidence rates, we are well poised to detect an acceleration in transmission of a particular lineage. Enabled with high-resolution descriptive epidemiological information, we can follow up with analytical epidemiological studies to test hypotheses about why a particular strain is rising in frequency. This exact process was critical to detecting the emergence of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) in the United Kingdom, and attributing the rise in frequency to the actual increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03470-x)(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg3055) Finally, a change in commonly-reported symptoms or illness severity associated with an increase in a particular genotype could indicate a change in the clinical presentation of illness, possibly associated with a genotypic change in the pathogen. Figure 2.2: Toy example of monitoring genotype frequencies. In the top panel of this figure we show a theoretical incidence plot. Below, the same incidence plot is shown given the addition of genomic data, which now allows us to measure genotype-specific incidence. Having a genotype-specific measure of incidence allows us to see how the frequency of different genotypes changes over time. Importantly, that information can provide critical situational awareness about an outbreak, providing warnings of genotypes that we may need to monitor more closely. 2.2 The value of genomic epidemiology for outbreak response. Pathogen genome sequences can help us detect or rule out linkages between cases. Similarly to how specific case definitions improve the sensitivity of traditional epidemiologic study designs, genomic data can support outbreak response by improving one’s ability to accurately classify which cases form an outbreak cluster. Below are some toy examples to clarify how this works, and to demonstrate how this information is useful in guiding public health practice. In this first toy example, imagine that three skilled nursing facilities in your community are all experiencing outbreaks of a particular illness. As spaces of congregate living, typically housing more vulnerable people, such facilities may be more prone to higher incidence of disease. Thus you may ask yourself, are the outbreaks I see in these three facilities independent outbreaks, attributable simply to the higher risk setting? Or might these outbreaks actually be linked? Furthermore, are all of the cases detected within the facilities linked? Or do some cases form a cluster, while others have simply been detected due to enhanced screening? Figure 3 below shows how genomic data can help elucidate some of these possibilities. From the surveillance data we can see that we have cases detected across all three SNFs. When we sequence the viruses from those infections, an interesting picture unfolds. Each SNF has a subset of cases with closely related genome-sequences (indicated here by colour). Each SNF also has cases whose genome sequences are distinct from each other and from the related infections found across all of the SNFs. This theoretical picture helps us understand a few things. Firstly, these are not three independent outbreaks, but rather one outbreak across three facilities. This may cause us to ask are residents transferred between facilities regularly? Do staff members work at multiple facilities? How can we limit inter-facility transmission? Secondly, not all of the cases that were detected across the SNFs are related to the outbreak. Rather, we have one primary cluster. Additionally, we have detected other cases of the disease that were likely acquired in the community, separately from the outbreak. Figure 2.3: Cases of a disease across three skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), without and with genomic sequencing data. In the first row we see that we have multiple cases of disease across three separate institutions. Without any additional knowledge about the cases, we might conclude that each SNF is experiencing an independent outbreak. The addition of genomic sequence data suggests that these SNFs are in fact all part of the same outbreak, given that they each of cases that are infected with the same genotype of the disease. Furthermore, the sequence data allows us to see which cases are really part of this multi-facility outbreak, and which infections are in fact unrelated prevalent cases detected through outbreak response efforts. Similarly, genomic data can distinguish cases that are not linked, even if they are detected within the same setting or facility, or infect individuals with similar demographic profiles. Distinguishing between unrelated and related cases within a single setting can enable epidemiologists to more clearly see what precise factor is leading to transmission. Let us take another toy example, in this case a factory where you detected an elevated incidence of disease above baseline. The cases are distributed across the factory, among both managerial staff who primarily work in offices and individuals working in assembling products. All the cases have been detected around the same time period, meaning that temporal pattern supports a single outbreak across the entire facility. In that case, what factor is facilitating transmission? How will you act in order to interrupt transmission? Figure 4 below shows how the addition of genomic data enables you to see that the cases among office-based managerial staff are unrelated to the cases occurring on the assembly line. While all cases occurred among employees of the factory, infections among managerial staff are genetically distinct from cases that occurred among assembly staff. Therefore, managerial infections appear to have been acquired externally from the workplace. In contrast, all cases among assembly staff are genetically related. Distinguishing the office staff cases from the case assembly staff cases allows you to see that any transmission occurring within the factory appears to be specific to the assembly area of the factory. This improves the sensitivity with which you can detect the factors or behaviors that are facilitating transmission, and hopefully making it easier to intervene. Figure 2.4: Here we see how the addition of genomic data changes our understanding of transmission within a factory. On the left, we see seven cases of infection, all within the same factory. This may lead us to believe that all of these cases are related, and perhaps became infected at work. The addition of genomic data helps us resolve this picture more. Once we have genotype information, we see that cases that work on the assembly floor all appear related, while cases among individuals who work in the offices appear unrelated, and are likely prevalent cases detected through enhanced surveillance efforts. Determining that workers in the office are not part of the factory outbreak helps us see that the occupational transmission risk appears related to work on the assembly line. This would allow us to target our intervention efforts towards this group of workers. 2.3 The value of retrospective data In public health we frequently want short turnaround times such that we can learn and act as quickly as possible. However, initially you might have delays in generating sequence data. While decreasing turn-around-times will help you to utilize the data in real-time to inform outbreak response, genomic data that are retrospective in nature are still useful! Sequencing retrospective samples can increase or change our understanding of the dynamics and timing of outbreaks. For example, sequencing older samples retrospectively might identify earlier detections of particular pathogen lineages, therefore suggesting that a lineage might be more prevalent in the present than assumed. Similarly, hypotheses about the role of particular events in initiating transmission or disseminating an outbreak might be altered or dismissed based on retrospective data. An early sequence might also become a “missing link” that adds weight towards a hypothesis that two distinguishable local transmission chains arose locally and were not the result of two separate introduction events. While it is rare for retrospective samples to be paradigm-shifting, we will nonetheless look into a handful of very extreme examples to show the kinds of phylogenetic insights retrospective samples may lead to. The HIV-1 group M pandemic resulted from a spillover event from central African chimpanzees, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was a likely starting point. However, owing to the late identification of HIV as the causative agent, the earliest genetic sequences of HIV-1 come from samples collected in the 1980s, likely multiple decades after the initial spillover event from chimpanzees into humans. With many years of transmission and evolution occurring before viruses were ever sequenced, the genome sequences from the 1980s are already quite divergent. Retrospective samples identified from two blood samples collected in Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, in 1959 and 1960 were illuminating. Both samples belonged to different subtypes of HIV-1 group M and thus indicated that substantial genetic diversity of HIV-1 was already present in the DRC by 1960. This finding helped revise our understanding of the origins of the HIV-1 pandemic, pushing back our estimates of when HIV-1 group M viruses spilled over into the human population to towards the turn of the century, a period of time involving rapid urbanization in central Africa. Figure X: Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 sequences from Worobey et al (2008). A similar and even more exaggerated example comes from ancient hepatitis B virus samples. Hepatitis B virus is a circular double-stranded DNA virus that infects hepatocytes and causes hepatitis. A number of genotypes of hepatitis B have been described, and genetic diversity tends to correspond to broad geographic regions. Because hepatitis B virus has a DNA genome, and double-stranded DNA is relatively stable, it has been possible to extract DNA from well-preserved hundreds to thousands year-old remains from all around the world. This work has allowed us to sequence ancient HBV viruses and compare them to contemporary sequences. One of the most surprising findings of these studies has been that all historical hepatitis B virus sequences to date clearly fall within known contemporaneous genotypic hepatitis B diversity, indicating that the diversification of hepatitis B virus predates any of the ancient samples. Figure X: Phylogenetic network of hepatitis B virus sequences from Krause-Kyora et al (2018). In both the HIV-1 group M and hepatitis B virus studies, retrospective sequencing provided a lot of new information because no information existed prior to contemporary sequences. Though this information isn’t actionable for any response happening now, it does nonetheless paint a much clearer picture of when these viruses emerged, and puts constraints on hypotheses about past events. Even though we have explored examples with timescales on the order of decades to hundreds of years, the broader lessons would hold in a similar contemporary situation. Even when data from an epidemic are plentiful, we may still have local blindspots. One example of this has been the Guinean portion of the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic, where a seemingly rare viral lineage was detected by three different groups who were sequencing sporadically during the epidemic. Each time the lineage was detected, it seemed to circulate at such low prevalence that each set of investigators thought that the lineage would likely not persist beyond the study period. The persistence of this lineage is remarkable because it was only ever detected at low frequencies despite reasonably robust genomic surveillance within Guinea, and yet it circulated for much of the outbreak. A potential hypothesis arising from these data is that this lineage actually circulated at higher frequencies, allowing the lineage to be sustained over long periods, but that it circulated in an area within Guinea where case detection or sequencing coverage was not as dense. When the lineage reached areas with good sequencing coverage it was observed, but only rarely. If we assume that PCR testing were done at the source location, and that those samples were somehow preserved, retrospective sequencing in regions of Guinea where sequencing was less intense could illuminate the circumstances that allowed this lineage to circulate for so long while only rarely being detected. At the end of the day, situations where retrospective sequencing can significantly alter our perspective will be more common in resource limited settings, and it is far more common for retrospective sequence data to fill in gaps and confirm transmission that we expect was happening. A clear example of this comes from the Seattle Flu Study, which ran in the Seattle area from January 1 to March 15, 2020. The goal of the study was to collect a large volume of samples from volunteers self-reporting respiratory symptoms. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the US was an individual returning from Wuhan on January 15, 2020 while the first case of community-acquired infection was 28 February, 2020. Samples collected during the Seattle Flu Study happened to include 65 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, including numerous samples spanning the time between the first travel-related case (January 15) and the first detected case of community transmission (February 28), thus filling an important gap in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during a time when the virus was establishing local transmission.

One of the challenges that comes hand-in-hand with that strength is that genomic epidemiology uses theory, analytical approaches, and jargon that surveillance epidemiologists may not be familiar with. In this Chapter we introduce the fundamental theory that underlies genomic epidemiological analysis and describe the terminology that genomic epidemiologists frequently use in describing and interpreting our analyses. This chapter, which summarizes the principles and mechanics of genomic epidemiology, should be pertinent to most readers of this handbook. 3.1 The overlapping timescales of pathogen evolution and pathogen transmission. Our ability to explore infectious disease dynamics using evolutionary analysis of pathogen genome sequences depends on a fundamental principle; pathogens evolve on roughly the same timescales as they circulate through a population of hosts. This principle means that the evolutionary trajectories of pathogens are shaped by the kinds of epidemiological and immunological forces that we, as public health practitioners, want to learn about. Pathogen genetic diversity becomes distributed in different ways depending on varying host movements, transmission dynamics, environments, and selective pressures, among other forces. Exploring those patterns can help us to understand to what extent these different factors shape epidemics. In the following sections we will describe how mutations occur within a single infected individual and discuss how this leads to viral diversity observed at the population level, across multiple infected individuals in an outbreak. 3.1.1 Viral diversity accumulates over the course of a single individual’s infection. In thinking about how pathogen diversity accumulates over an epidemic we begin with the processes occurring during one individual’s infection. In the example that follows we will consider an RNA virus. These pathogens are highly amenable to genomic epidemiology because they evolve rapidly and replicate to large population sizes. This enables us to visualize and discuss the dynamics of the evolutionary processes more readily. To begin, imagine the index case of our theoretical viral outbreak. Upon infection, the virus enters into that person’s cells, hijacking some of the host cell machinery to make the proteins that it will need to generate progeny virions. The virus must also copy it’s RNA genome such that these genome copies can be packaged into the progeny virions. To do this, RNA viruses rely on a protein called the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). While our cells have polymerases that transcribe DNA to RNA, these won’t work for making an RNA copy of an RNA genome. Thus almost all RNA viruses bring along their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for performing the task of replicating their genome. Unlike our polymerases, the majority of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lack proofreading capabilities. That means that during the process of genome replication, when the polymerase makes a mistake and incorporates the wrong nucleotide into the new genome it is transcribing, that base will stay there uncorrected, representing a change in the sequence of the “child” (the newly copied genome) compared to the “parent” (the template genome). These replication “typos” happen frequently; broadly speaking, one or two mutations like this occur every single replication cycle. With a random change occurring at one site in the genome pretty much every replication cycle, a genome length on the order of tens of thousands of sites, and millions or even billions of progeny virions being generated over the course of a single person’s infection, pretty much every single change to a genome sequence that could occur will occur during a single person’s infection. Thus, within a single infection, there is a large amount of pathogen genetic diversity, which we typically refer as within-host diversity. 3.1.2 Stochasticity and selection influence variant frequency of within an infection. The mutations that yield all this within-host viral diversity do not represent changes the virus is making towards some trait. They are simply transcription errors, like typos that you might make while typing rapidly, and they will be distributed across the sites of the genome. Some of these mutations will have detrimental impacts, even lethal ones, that make a progeny virion less fit or even unviable. We refer to such mutations as deleterious mutations. Some mutations will have absolutely no effect on the fitness virion at all; we refer to these as neutral mutations. Some mutations could confer a fitness benefit to the progeny virion; these are beneficial mutations. While the occurrence of mutations themselves is a random process governed primarily by the error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the impact that different mutations have on the ability of the progeny virion to infect cells and replicate will influence the frequency of those mutations within the diversity of an individual’s infection. Mutations that are lethal or highly deleterious will be purged from the viral population quite quickly, as the progeny virions that carry those mutations fail to complete their replication cycle. Conversely, if a mutation is beneficial, perhaps it allows the virion to replicate more quickly, then the virion carrying that mutation will generate greater numbers of progeny, and the frequency or that mutation in the viral population will rise. Neutral mutations, which do not result in any functional changes to the virus, will rise or fall in frequency stochastically. Notably, deleterious to neutral to beneficial is a spectrum, and how significantly the mutation will change in frequency depends on how impactful the mutation is, as well as chance. 3.1.3 When a transmission event occurs, the within-host viral diversity of the infector is sampled and transmitted to the recipient. Over the course of a single individual’s infection, mutations occur, generating slightly genetically-different viral populations within the infected person, and the frequency of these within-host variants rises, falls, or stays the same, as governed by chance and selective forces. But in genomic epidemiology our interest is typically in the process of transmission between individuals, not in the process of a single individual’s infection. So, what occurs at the time of transmission? At the time of transmission, the within-host viral diversity of the infector is sampled and transmitted to the infectee. How many virions are “sampled” from the infector, and how many virions it actually takes to cause an infection in the recipient, varies from pathogen to pathogen. This concept is termed the transmission bottleneck. When transmission bottlenecks are narrow, just a small fraction of the viral diversity present within the infector is passed along to the recipient to initiate their infection. When transmission bottlenecks are wide, many virions are sampled from the infector and transmitted to the recipient. While you do not need to know the width of the transmission bottleneck to conduct genomic epidemiological analysis, we bring up this concept because the width of transmission bottlenecks influence how genetic diversity gets passed along between individuals over the course of an outbreak. When the bottleneck is narrow, and just a small fraction of within-host diversity is passed along, random chance will play a significant role in which virions are transmitted and “found” the recipient individual’s infection. In contrast, when the transmission bottleneck is wide, then the sample of the infector’s within host diversity is more likely to mirror the extent and frequency of their within-host diversity, and the sample of viruses that founds the recipient’s infection is likely to be similar to the infector’s viral diversity at the time of transmission. Thus, the width of the transmission bottleneck influences how the viral diversity accumulating within a single infection gets passed along. Because the within-host diversity of an infection is changing over the whole duration of that person’s infection, transmission events occurring at different time points in the infector’s infection will result in different samples of the viral diversity being transmitted. Similarly, because only a sample of the infector’s viral diversity is transmitted on to a recipient, if a single infector were to infect many recipients at the same time, those recipient infections would be founded with slightly different samples of the infector’s within host diversity as well. 3.1.4 Consensus genomes provide a summary of the within-host diversity. Despite the importance of within-host diversity to the overlapping timescales of pathogen evolution and transmission, in genomic epidemiology we most often look at a summary of within-host diversity, not the entirety of the diversity. This summary is the consensus genome. The consensus genome represents the most frequently observed nucleotide at each site in the genome at the time of sample collection. At some sites in the genome there may be very little within-host diversity, and the vast majority of sequences support the same nucleotide. At other sites there might be higher levels of nucleotide diversity. In such cases this diversity can be summarized in the consensus genome with a nucleotide ambiguity code. These codes are letters that are not A, C, T, or G, but denote what nucleotide mixture was observed. For example, if at a site in the genome you have 40% of sequencing reads supporting an A and 60% of sequencing reads supporting a C, you might choose to summarize this diversity in your consensus genome by using the ambiguous site M, which means A or C. There are various decisions surrounding what thresholds of within-host diversity you would like to capture in a consensus genome sequence; a deep discussion of these tradeoffs and parameterizations of bioinformatic pipelines is beyond the scope of this introduction. While the consensus genome sequence provides a summary of the within-host viral diversity at cross-section in time, it does not capture the full course of the within-host diversity. Moreover, the consensus genome does not capture all of the diversity present at the time of sampling. Many of the mutations that arise during the process of viral replication will remain at such low frequencies that a “real” mutation is not discernible from a mutation arising from PCR amplification or a sequencing error. As such, the consensus genome will not capture many of the mutations that occur over the course of an infection. This is one of the reasons why consensus genome sequences can be identical between closely linked infections, even though viruses are mutating with every replication cycle. This dynamic also means that the rate at which we observe changes in the consensus genome sequence of different infections is different, that is slower, than the biologically-governed mutational rate of the pathogen. Because the rate at which we observe these changes is different from the actual fundamental mutation rate of a pathogen, we have varied terminology for describing these processes, that we describe in the next section of this chapter. 3.2 Terminology for describing changes in genetic sequences. Vocabulary can be tricky, and the meanings of different terms may vary between academic domains. Furthermore, you may hear multiple terms for describing the same phenomenon. Sometimes these terms are synonyms, and other times they may have distinct meanings. Here, we aim to provide some clarity surrounding terms used in genomic epidemiology to discuss observed changes in microbial genetic sequences. When dealing with microbial populations, the terms mutation and SNP (which stands for s ingle n ucleotide p olymorphism) are often used interchangeably. They refer to changes in the genetic sequence of the organism, at a single site in that organism’s genome. You can observe a mutation or a SNP by comparing multiple aligned genetic sequences to each other. You may also hear mutations referred to as alleles, although this term can be confusing since it has a slightly different meaning when discussing the genetics of organisms that only carry one copy of their genetic material (such as viruses and bacteria) and the genetics of organisms that carry two or more copies of their genetic materials (such as humans). The pattern of mutations that you observe across a sequence, summarized by the consensus genome sequence, is typically described as the genotype. Because viruses and bacteria are haploid, meaning they only carry a single copy of their genetic material, this single sequence defines their genotype. When you observe multiple samples with identical consensus genome sequences, we often describe these as multiple detections of the same genotype. We use the term substitution to denote when a mutation has become completely dominant, and that all sequences in a particular population now carry that mutation. When this population-wide replacement happens, that mutation is said to be fixed in the population. Knowing when a mutation has fixed, and therefore become a substitution, is challenging since it requires knowledge about the genetic diversity of the entire population. Therefore, while the term is used quite frequently, it may not always be used entirely correctly. You will likely encounter the term “substitution” most frequently when discussing the rate at which we expect to observe nucleotide changes accumulating; these rates are frequently referred to as substitution rates, although given the challenge of truly knowing when a mutation has become a substitution, they are most appropriately called evolutionary rates. We discuss these various rates, and how to measure them, in the next section of this chapter. 3.3 Mutation rates, evolutionary rates, and molecular clocks The term mutation rate denotes the actual rate at which a microbe’s DNA or RNA polymerase makes errors while replicating the genome. This quantity is challenging to measure, since it requires specialized experimental designs. Thus the actual intrinsic mutation rates of many organisms are not known. Most mutations that the polymerase makes while replicating the genome are so detrimental that the organisms that carry them die out quickly, and those mutations are never observed. Thus much of the genetic variation we actually observe is neutral or nearly neutral. These neutral and nearly neutral mutations accumulate in a population in a way that depends on the population’s size (more replicating individuals means more chances for new mutations to arise) and the intrinsic mutation rate of the organism. This rate at which mutations accumulate after selection has filtered out deleterious variation is called the evolutionary rate. Unlike the mutation rate, which depends most greatly on the functional characteristics of the polymerase, the evolutionary rate is the product of multiple intersecting features of the organism. These include the mutation rate, the amount of time it takes for the organism to replicate its genome and produce progeny, the size of the population of replicating individuals, the ability of the organism’s genome to tolerate mutations, and the degree and type of selection acting upon the organism. Beyond these organism-specific factors, the evolutionary rate will also be influenced by your sampling scheme. For example, a dataset containing sequences collected infrequently over longer time periods may have a slower evolutionary rate, since there has been more time for purifying selection to remove deleterious variation from the population. Conversely, densely sequenced outbreaks may show slightly higher rates of evolution, since the intensive sampling of infections over short time frames may capture more of the deleterious or mildly-deleterious variation that would otherwise be purged from the population. While the probability of a mutation occurring during viral replication is random, when we look through time at large populations of organisms, we see that mutations accrue across the genome according to a relatively constant evolutionary rate. In genomic epidemiology, this signal of evolution over time is often referred to as the molecular clock, and it enables genomic epidemiologists to translate an observed number of mutations into an estimate of how much calendar time was necessary for that variation to accrue. The simplest way to estimate the molecular clock is to look at the correlation between when a sample was collected and the genetic divergence of the sequence. We measure the genetic divergence of a sampled sequence by comparing the sampled sequence at the tip of our tree to the root sequence of our tree, and counting how many mutations separate the two sequences. The root represents the ancestor of all sequences in our dataset, the sequence of the ancestral organism from which all of the diversity in our dataset descends. Most commonly, the root sequence is inferred during phylogenetic inference. However, in rare cases, we may actually sample the root sequence. This appears to be true for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in which the global diversity that we observe appears to have accumulated on top of the genetic background of the first sequences sampled from Wuhan. To improve accuracy and precision, we estimate the molecular clock using many sequences sampled serially, that is, over time. For each sample in our dataset, the x-axis position is given by the sample collection date, and the genetic divergence between the root sequence and the tip sequence (often called the root-to-tip distance), gives the y-axis position. Using multiple samples we can build up a scatter plot, which in this context is often referred to as a clock plot or a root-to-tip plot. Then, to estimate the evolutionary rate from the root-to-tip plot, we draw a regression line through all the points. The slope of this line provides an expectation of the evolutionary rate. This estimate, which is drawn from the subset of samples that we include in our dataset, is specific to the sequences we are considering and how they were sampled. As such, you may see evolutionary rates shift slightly when analyzing different datasets of the same pathogen, but usually this variation is minimal. Evolutionary rates are frequently given in one of two forms; normalized to the genome length, or non-normalized. Normalized evolutionary rates represent the evolutionary rate of a single site in the genome. These normalized rates are useful because they can be compared across different organisms. In contrast, non-normalized evolutionary rates represent the total number of nucleotide changes you would likely observe across the entire genome. They can be more interpretable, but they are specific to the pathogen and its genome size. When using non-normalized rates, it is important to remember that two different pathogens with identical per site evolutionary rates, but different genome lengths, will accumulate different total numbers of mutations over time; the pathogen with the longer genome will accumulate more mutations. We emphasize this point since we have invariably seen alarming headlines about rates of evolution that compare normalized to non-normalized rates, or that compare non-normalized rates between different pathogens with different genome sizes. Luckily, translating between normalized and non-normalized evolutionary rates is simple. If you start with the normalized, per-site evolutionary rate, and multiply that quantity by the genome length, you will arrive at the non-normalized rate. Similarly, dividing a non-normalized genome rate by the genome length will return the normalized, per-site evolutionary rate. How should you interpret the evolutionary rate? Generally, we describe this quantity as an expectation of the amount of nucleotide divergence we would observe between two randomly selected sequences sampled some amount of time apart from each other. For example, imagine you estimate that your pathogen of interest has a non-normalized evolutionary rate of 20.5 substitutions per year. This rate means that, on average, if you randomly select two sequences from your population that were collected exactly one year apart, they would be separated by 20.5 mutations. While in reality if you actually look at the number of nucleotide mutations separating sequences sampled a year apart you would observe various whole numbers of mutations, if you were to do this procedure a many times over, you should arrive at the expectation given by the slope of the regression line through your root-to-tip plot. This ability to translate observed genetic divergence into an estimate of how much calendar time has passed opens up a number of tools for us. Firstly, it enables “back-of-the-envelope” calculations of how much time likely separates two sequences. This can be particularly handy when investigating potential epidemiological linkage between two sequenced cases. Secondly, molecular clocks enable us to translate genetic divergence trees into temporally-resolved phylogenetic trees, or time trees. Finally, root-to-tip plots are also excellent (and quick!) ways to perform data quality control and look for interesting biology and epidemiological patterns. For example, if sequencing or bioinformatic assembly has gone awry, your sequences will often show greater nucleotide divergence from the root than you would expect given when they were sampled. They would thus appear as outliers that deviate from your molecular clock. Similarly, if the date of collection is recorded incorrectly, then a sequence might look over- or under-diverged given the sampling date. This might be hard to identify in a spreadsheet, but will often jump out at you in a root-to-tip plot. Finally, deviation from the molecular clock may also alert you to more rare infectious disease dynamics, such as relapses or reactivations of latent disease. Indeed, observations of deviation from the molecular clock provided some of the first evidence that Ebola virus could be sexually transmitted from recovered individuals after many months. 3.4 Phylogenetic trees 3.4.1 What is a phylogenetic tree? Phylogenetic trees are hierarchical diagrams that describe relationships between organisms. Specifically, phylogenies are hypotheses of common descent, whereby sequences that have seemingly inherited the same mutations will cluster together. Phylogenetic trees are composed of tips (also called leaves), internal nodes, and branches. Tips represent directly observed samples; you know the genetic sequence of the tips of a tree because you actually sequenced that sample. These are the samples that you use to infer the phylogenetic tree. In a tree, tips can be presented as a branch that simply ends, or more commonly, the name of the sample or a shape (often a circle) will be placed at the end of the branch to indicate the tip. The x-axis position of a tip is given by the observed genetic divergence between that sample and the root sequence of the tree. Internal nodes represent hypothetical common ancestors that were not directly observed, but that we infer existed given the genetic patterns we see among the tips. These two types of objects are connected by branches. In genetic divergence phylogenies, when the pathogen population is sampled very densely it is possible to find samples (tips) with zero branch length. That is, the tips are at the same divergence level as their inferred common ancestor. This indicates that the genotype of the inferred common ancestor is the same as an actual sequence in the dataset. Branches form the connections between nodes and tips in the tree, and they represent direct ancestor-descendant relationships. Branches can be external if a branch connects an internal node to its descendent tip or internal if a branch connects two internal nodes. Since phylogenetic trees model a hypothesis of genetic descent, internal nodes and tips have a sequence (either inferred or known, respectively). Mutations occur along branches, such that when the ancestor (or parent) node does not have a particular mutation, but the descendant (or child) does, then the mutation was gained along the branch that connects parent to the child. When evolution proceeds via this process of descent, mutations that happen early on, and are inherited as part of the genetic backdrop that new mutations continually arise upon, will be present across many of the sampled and inferred sequences. It is this pattern of shared mutations and unique mutations that enable the hierarchical clustering that occurs in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3.1). Groups of sequences that share a particular mutation are inferred to have inherited that mutation and cluster together, descending from the branch where that mutation occurred. In contrast, sequences that do not share that same mutation are likely not part of the same pattern of descent, and will cluster in a different part of the tree. Taking all of these patterns together allows us to build trees in which smaller and smaller groups of sequences group together with a shared pattern of inherited mutations. While most of the structure of the tree is formed by looking at patterns of shared genetic variation, some mutations will be unique to a sampled sequence. In this case, these mutations occur on the external branches that lead to the tips. The external branch length will be a function of the number of unique mutations that tip has. Figure 3.1: On the left is a theoretical multiple sequence alignment of genomes A through F. Shared mutations are found in multiple samples, while unique mutations are found only in one sampled sequence. We use this pattern of shared and unique mutations to build the phylogenetic tree, which hierarchically clusters tips according to which mutations they share. Mutations occur along branches, such that tips that descend from a branch will share that mutation. When mutations are shared by more samples, then those mutations would have occurred more deeply in the tree. Mutations that are unique to samples occur on external branches, whose only descendent is the sampled tip. Within the phylogenetic tree, subgroups encompassing a common ancestor and all of its descendants are typically referred to as clades (or sometimes lineages). We define clades according to the mutations that the samples within the clade have inherited and all share. Clades are useful to consider when thinking about potentially altered biological properties. If a particular lineage has acquired novel mutations, and those mutations are passed on to its descendants, the entire clade would be expected to show the particular functional characteristics associated with the mutation(s) they all share. Notably, because the phylogenetic clustering pattern is hierarchical, so are clades. Two sequences might cluster together into a small clade defined by a mutation that only they share. But those sequences can also be grouped within a larger clade, with additional samples, defined by a different set of mutations that occurred further back in the tree and were inherited by additional samples in the tree (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: A hypothetical phylogenetic tree with hierarchical clades/lineages annotated. It is common to encounter other embellishments on phylogenetic trees. For example, branches can be coloured to indicate inferred traits of ancestors in the tree. Common traits reconstructed on trees include geography or host. This annotation helps genomic epidemiologists understand the history and dynamics driving an epidemic. Another common addition, particularly to phylogenetic tree figures in scientific papers, are numbers or markers placed near or on nodes. These markers are a common way to indicate the statistical support for a given node (remember that each node is only a hypothesis of common descent). It has also become popular to mark mutations, particularly those changing amino acids in proteins, above the branch along which the mutations likely occurred.

It has also become popular to mark mutations, particularly those changing amino acids in proteins, above the branch along which the mutations likely occurred. Phylogenetic trees come in two categories: rooted and unrooted. An unrooted tree simply displays the inferred relationships between the samples without making any assumptions about where the tree begins. In contrast, rooted phylogenies explicitly state our hypothesis regarding the directionality of evolution. Within genomic epidemiology, you will primarily encounter rooted phylogenies, which is why we will concentrate on them in this section. Within a rooted phylogeny, the direction of evolution proceeds from the root out towards the tips. Nodes that are basal in the tree, or deeper in the tree, are ancestral to nodes that are closer towards the tips. Rooted phylogenies are typically displayed in rectangular form, with the direction of evolution proceeding from the left to the right. In this format, the most basal node, the root, is the node that is furthest to the left, and descendants of that node will appear to the right of that node. That said, rooted phylogenies can be shown in other conformations as well, such as circular or top-to-bottom. In these cases, just remember that the direction of evolution proceeds from the root toward the tips. The branches are scaled in terms of genetic divergence, or the number of expected changes per nucleotide site. Figure 3.3: A hypothetical phylogenetic tree showing directionality. When we refer to a node being more basal within the tree, we mean deeper in the tree, closer to the root. The root is the most basal internal node in the tree. This phylogenetic tree is rectangular and oriented left-to-right. This means that the left-most internal node is the most basal, and the root, and that evolution proceeds forward from that node, moving from left-to-right. 3.4.2 Assessing and reading a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees might seem simple, but correctly interpreting them is not always straightforward. For beginners and advanced users alike, interpreting a phylogenetic tree can present a challenge because the y-axis in a phylogenetic tree is meaningless. It is used to lay out all of the tips so they do not overlap - the proximity of any two tips along the y-axis does not indicate anything about their relatedness. This also means that the branching in a phylogeny can be rotated without altering the meaning of the diagram in any way. Because phylogenies sacrifice an entire dimension for clearly laying tips, there is also a limit on how much information can be packed into simple phylogenetic tree figures, and even moderately sized phylogenetic trees presented under ideal conditions can vary enormously in their ability to communicate key messages. In learning how to assess a phylogenetic tree, we will consider only rooted phylogenetic trees, since you probably will not encounter scenarios where unrooted trees are necessary. One of the first things to check in a rooted tree is whether the root of the tree seems appropriate. The root of the tree represents the common ancestor of all your samples. Rooting determines the order of branching in the tree, and thus whether the root is correct or not will make all the difference when interpreting the tree. Ask yourself: “What lies on either side of the very first split in the tree?” You should be able to find a reference sequence representing the earliest known genome of a pathogen, or a fairly distinct but related organism (often termed an outgroup), or some known historical split in the pathogen’s population on one side of the root. Of course there are always caveats to this rule of thumb, but generally the rooting and directionality you observe in the tree should match your understanding of the pathogen’s descriptive epidemiology. Figure 3.3 below shows an example of how incorrectly rooting a phylogenetic tree can fundamentally, and incorrectly, alter your understanding of an evolutionary trajectory. Figure 3.4: Rooting the phylogenetic tree of great apes. At the top we see the unrooted phylogeny, as well as two possible places we might place the root, one of which is correct and the other is incorrect. In selecting the root we describe a pattern of evolutionary descent out from the root. When the incorrect root is selected, on one side of the split we have chimpanzees and bonobos. On the other side of the split we have humans, gorillas, and orangutans. This does not match our understanding of evolutionary relationships between humans and great apes, and thus this particular split should alert us that the tree is incorrectly rooted. However, when the correct root is selected, as shown on the right hand side, we see a pattern of descent in which orangutans are on one side of the split, and chimpanzees, bonobos, humans, and gorillas are on the other side of the split. Chimpanzees and bonobos are most closely related to each other, followed by humans, then by gorillas. Emanating from the root are branches representing direct lines of descent from the common ancestor. When looking at a genetic divergence phylogenetic tree, you will typically see that branch lengths are scaled in terms of a normalized number of substitutions per site in the genome. For increased interpretability, branches in genetic divergence trees may also be scaled in terms of total number of substitutions observed across the entire genome. Either way, both of these scalings represent an amount of sequence change that has occurred. One thing to watch out for in genetic divergence phylogenies are particularly long branches, often at the tips. As discussed in the previous section, the length of a branch leading to a tip is scaled according to the number of mutations that are observed within that sample’s sequence, but not in other samples in the tree. If the numbers of mutations that are unique to a sample are very large, it is often an indicator of a sequence quality issue (for example, a sequencing error, or a bioinformatics issue with genome assembly). 3.4.3 Temporally-resolved phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic trees discussed thus far describe an inheritance process for the mutations observed in an alignment of sequences; these are genetic divergence phylogenetic trees. However, there is a second type of tree that you will commonly encounter in genomic epidemiology: temporally-resolved phylogenetic trees, also referred to as time trees. Time trees make use of the molecular clock that we described earlier in this chapter to translate the amount of genetic divergence observed along branches of the tree into an estimate of the amount of calendar time that likely passed. This translation results in a tree where branch lengths are measured in absolute time rather than in genetic divergence. A few other shifts will occur in a time tree as well. Firstly, the position of the tips of the tree (those viruses that you have actually sampled and sequenced) is fixed at the date of sample collection, rather than representing how diverged a sample is from the root sequence. Secondly, the position of internal nodes in the tree is representative of when we think that ancestral node likely existed. The estimated date of an internal node in the tree comes from observing the sequence diversity of the descendents, and asking, “How far back in time would you need to go in order to find the common ancestor of these descendants?” This quantity is referred to as the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). For trees scaled in absolute time, it is not uncommon to indicate the range of uncertainty associated with the inferred date by providing a 95% confidence interval around the date. This may be given as a numerical range, or shown visually with a rectangle or a violin plot to show the full probability density. Time trees have several useful properties that support epidemiological inference. Exploring trees along the dimension of time makes the tree more useful from a descriptive epidemiological perspective. For example, when we can move between genetic divergence trees and time trees, we can easily compare how the genomic diversity between samples aligns with the number of serial intervals separating sample collection dates. Furthermore, when we join information about sequenced samples (e.g. where they were collected) with information on when the common ancestors of those sequences likely circulated, we can begin to reconstruct when spatial movements of a pathogen occurred. This latter procedure is commonly referred to as phylogeography. To discern whether you are looking at a time tree or a genetic divergence tree, look at the x-axis label or scale bar of your tree. If branch lengths are scaled in terms of absolute time (calendar time), then you have a time tree. Alternatively, if branch lengths are given in substitutions, or substitutions per site, then you are looking at a genetic divergence tree. 3.5 The transmission tree does not equate the phylogenetic tree. 3.6 Why is sequencing better at dismissing links than confirming them? "],["sample-selection.html", "Chapter 4 Sample selection 4.1 Representative Sampling 4.2 Targeted Sampling 4.3 Contextual data", " Chapter 4 Sample selection In this Chapter we describe two major approaches to sample selection for genomic epidemiological studies. We describe when you should use these different sampling strategies, focusing on which types of questions you may be interested in, and how the particular sampling strategy supports the goal of your investigation. This Chapter is pertinent for any readers who are actively seeking to implement genomic surveillance programs and integrate genomic epidemiology into their public health investigations. Readers who want to understand why different sampling strategies are useful will also benefit from reading these sections. 4.1 Representative Sampling In representative sampling, a set of specimens are selected for sequencing such that the pathogen genetic diversity in the sequenced sample set is representative of the pathogen genetic diversity circulating in the broader population. This means that the investigator should be able to detect the same suite of genotypes in their sample as circulate in the broader population, and that the frequencies with which they observe different genotypes in their sequenced dataset should reflect the frequencies with which those genotypes are found in the broader population. To maintain these attributes and protect the validity of their dataset, the investigator must ensure that they do not accidentally enrich for certain genotypes by preferentially sequencing samples that have a particular diagnostic trait, a particular clinical presentation, or affect a particular demographic group. Furthermore, to maintain a representative dataset, the investigator must also avoid systematically excluding certain genotypes that are circulating in the population. Genotype exclusion can occur when you lack sequences from a particular portion of your population that does not mix homogeneously with everyone else in your population. For example, if you have an under-served population that co-mingles, but has limited contact with other groups in your community, then a certain pathogen genotype could circulate primarily within that community. If that population lacks equitable access to testing, then you may not detect transmission within the community or sequence the circulating genotype(s). This situation would lead you to miss or underestimate the prevalence of those genotypes. Generally, we recommend using representative sampling when exploring surveillance questions, such as: What is the frequency of this variant in my population? How are frequencies of these different variants changing over time? What is the spatial distribution of different pathogen genotypes? When was this particular pathogen genotype introduced to this population, and how long has it circulated for? How much pathogen diversity do we observe in our community, and how does this relate to pathogen diversity in other communities? 4.2 Targeted Sampling In targeted sampling we aim to sequence as many samples as possible from a particular population, outbreak, or transmission chain, in order to understand the specific genotypes and disease dynamics associated with that population or setting. Examples of when we use targeted sampling include: Investigating populations showing particular clinical presentations of a disease to see whether a specific pathogen genotype appears correlated with an altered disease presentation. Exploring whether an outbreak in a localized setting, such as a workplace, school, or medical facility, is the result of transmission occurring within the setting. Alternatively, infections could be acquired in the broader community, and simply detected in the localized setting, for example due to increased screening in the facility. Investigating a particular set of cases that report an epidemiologic link to determine whether they are indeed part of the same transmission chain. Investigating individuals presenting with a second acute period of illness, to distinguish between a reinfection event and reactivation of latent disease. 4.3 Contextual data Targeted sampling focuses on deeply sampling particular settings, transmission chains, or infections that meet case definitions. Yet, to analyze those datasets appropriately, you need to include representatively-sampled genome sequences alongside your targeted samples. Within genomic epidemiology, we often refer to these other representative samples as contextual data. They provide a backdrop for what is happening more broadly outside of your densely sequenced target population, and can improve analytic inferences. Importantly, they also serve as controls, enabling you to see whether dynamics observed in your targeted population are unique to that population, or whether they are typical of the broader set of sequenced cases. 4.3.1 Contextual data as a backdrop Including contextual data in the analysis of transmission dynamics within a targeted setting enables the public health practitioner to see whether the pathogen genotypes associated with the outbreak circulated in the community before and/or after the outbreak. This contextual information can potentially clarify how an outbreak began, and when it has truly ended. Furthermore, including contextual data in a targeted analysis can help elucidate links between an outbreak in the targeted population and transmission in the broader community. That information can help the epidemiologist to see whether an outbreak amplified transmission and seeded it in the broader population. Additionally, if the bounds of an outbreak aren’t truly known, representative samples that appear related to targeted samples may indicate a connection to the outbreak that was not previously known. Finally, including sequences sampled over longer time periods will make estimates of the molecular clock more accurate, and often more precise. When the cases of interest within your targeted analysis occur over a short time window, as in the case of small, localized outbreaks, including contextual sequences sampled over longer periods of time will ensure that your time tree analyses remain accurate. 4.3.2 Contextual data as controls Imagine that you are interested in a cluster of illnesses that have a different disease presentation. You wonder whether a change in the pathogen itself might be responsible for the changed clinical manifestation. To investigate, you decide to sequence pathogen genomes from cases that meet a case definition for the new clinical presentation. In the absence of an association between pathogen genotype and disease presentation, you may find that all of these individuals with similar disease presentations are infected with distinct and diverse pathogen genotypes. However, what if the individuals who meet your case definition are infected with the same or similar genotypes? Does that mean that there is an association between the genotype and disease presentation? Not necessarily. Only looking at sequences from individuals showing a specific clinical course would be like only looking at the people who got sick after eating at a “poisoned picnic”. If every sick case at the picnic ate the potato salad, then you might conclude that the potato salad is to blame. But what if everyone ate the potato salad, including your controls who did not get sick after the picnic? Then the potato salad is probably not the culprit. The validity of your study depends on the controls. Similarly, representatively-sampled contextual sequences act as controls in genomic epidemiological analyses. They allow you to see which pathogen genotypes circulate in individuals not presenting with the altered clinical course. Much like the case where everyone at the picnic ate the potato salad, it is completely possible that a particular genotype is dominantly circulating in a community and causing infections with varied clinical presentations. If this is the case, then your targeted samples may all be infected with the same genotype, but your representatively-sampled contextual sequences will also show that same genotype. Just like controls in traditional epidemiological studies, contextual sequences should be collected from individuals who would have been sequenced as part of your targeted sampling effort had they fit the criteria that is guiding your targeted sampling effort.

For each of these areas, we provide concrete examples of the types of questions that fall within these topical areas, the fundamental theoretical principles that you will draw upon to investigate those questions, and different sampling schemes and analysis methods for investigating those questions. This chapter is pertinent to most readers, as it describes the public health utility of different genomic epidemiologic analyses. Additionally, readers engaged in building genomic epidemiological capacity or in performing genomic epidemiology themselves will benefit from the descriptions of how to design, analyze, and interpret various genomic epidemiological investigations. 5.1 Assessing linkage between cases 5.1.1 What kinds of questions fall into this topic? Both of these cases have similar reported exposures. Is that common exposure the likely source of both infections? I have multiple detections of disease in the workplace. Is workplace transmission occurring, or were unrelated community-acquired infections detected at the same time? I have multiple cases that were assigned the same Pango lineage. Are these cases closely-related? There is an outbreak going on in our prison system, and there are also cases in our intake jails. Are infections in intake jails contributing to prison outbreaks? I have two detections of a variant of concern from the same week, and I’ve never seen that variant in my jurisdiction before. Do these cases represent community transmission of the variant of concern, or are these cases independent introductions? I’ve detected two cases of a disease in the same household. Is this an instance of household transmission, or did the cases contract the disease separately outside the home? 5.1.2 Fundamental principles As a pathogen, let’s say a virus, circulates in a population, it infects different people. During those infections, the virus replicates, making errors as it copies its genome for packaging into progeny virions. While different pathogens make errors at different rates, and we may see substitutions in consensus genomes at different rates (see Chapter 3 - mutations versus substitutions), this principle means that pathogen genome sequences will accumulate changes over the course of an outbreak. This process also means that cases separated by a minimal amount of transmission will generally have more genetically similar infections, while cases that are separated by large amounts of transmission will typically have more genetically divergent infections. 5.1.3 What kind of sampling do you need to answer the question? When you are looking at the pathogen genome sequences of two infections you are not extrapolating from those data to a broader understanding of the outbreak as a whole. Therefore, you can assess possible linkages between cases using sequences collected through either a targeted sampling scheme or a representative sampling scheme. That said, it remains important to include contextual sequence data in your analysis, as described in Chapter 3 and as shown in Figure 5.1 below. Figure 5.1: A toy example showing the importance of including contextual data when assessing linkage between cases. On the left-hand side is a phylogenetic tree including only three samples of interest. On the right-hand side, we show a phylogenetic tree of the same three samples of interest (orange tips) along with closely-related contextual data (blue tips). The addition of contextual data clarifies the relationships between the samples of interest. In the tree on the left, we might assume that A and B are related cases, since they both share a mutation and are only two nucleotides diverged from each other. However, the addition of contextual data (blue) provides a more nuanced picture. We see that samples of interest A and B are in fact more closely related to contextual sequences than they are to each other. This could mean that A and B are not directly epidemiologically-linked, or it might mean that A and B are both part of a larger transmission chain captured by the contextual sequences. Furthermore, contextual data can make it more clear when samples are diverged. While we can see substantial genetic divergence between sample C and samples A and B in the tree on the left, the addition of contextual data makes it more clear that C is unrelated to samples A and B. 5.1.4 What tools or approaches can you use to answer the question? To investigate questions of linakge you will need a way to compare and summarize the genetic similarity between cases of interest. There are multiple methods for summarizing genetic distances between samples, but we generally recommend using tree structures such as phylogenetic placements or phylogenetic trees (see Chapter 7 for more details) when assessing sequence similarity between samples. While it is technically possible to build a tree structure with just your samples of interest, we caution against doing this, as the addition of other contextual sequences usually makes the relationships between your samples of interest more clear. Furthermore, in the case that your samples of interest are not genetically similar to each other, the presence of contextual sequences allows you to see other samples that they are closely-related to (Figure 5.1). Both phylogenetic placements and phylogenetic trees will provide a tree structure for assessing similarity between samples of interest. However, during public health investigations, our questions about the genetic similarity of samples of interest are usually limited in scope and we need answers quickly. When rapid situational awareness is more important than a richer analysis, we recommend performing a phylogenetic placement. If after performing a phylogenetic placement you have further descriptive epidemiological questions about the samples, then we recommend following-up a phylogenetic placement with inferring a phylogenetic tree. 5.1.5 Caveats, limitations, and ways things go wrong As discussed in Chapter 3, genomic data are powerful for ruling linkage out, but less powerful for unequivocally ruling linkage in. Furthermore, except in rare cases, you cannot infer the directionality of transmission from sequence data alone when you have highly genetically-similar consensus genomes. This principle is probably clearest when cases have identical genome sequences, since if all of the sequences are the same there’s no genomic signal for directionality. However, we caution that directionality is still challenging to infer accurately even when some genomes are slightly diverged. As an example of this issue, in Figure 5.2 we illustrate two different transmission patterns that yield the sample phylogenetic tree topology. In the first scenario, we have a person-to-person transmission pattern, where directionality is A to B to C to D. In the second scenario we instead have a superspreading event, in which individual A directly infects person B, person C, and person D. Despite having different transmission patterns, the genetic divergence trees are identical. This example shows how challenging it can be to disentangle genetic diversity accrued during person-to-person transmission from within-host diversity that is transmitted when an index case infects multiple secondary cases. Figure 5.2: Different transmission patterns between individuals A, B, C, and D can yield identical genetic divergence trees. On the left we show a transmission chain in which individual A infects B, who infects C, who then infects D. Depending on the evolutionary rate of our pathogen, we may not see mutations arise in every single consensus genome. Indeed, here we see that the sequences from individuals A, B, and C are identical. Thus without knowledge of the true transmission pattern, we would not be able to detect the directionality of transmission between those three individuals. Furthermore, while one might initially think that directionality for individual D is possible to infer, comparison of the scenarios on the left and right show how directionality can become convoluted by within-host diversity. On the left, individual D’s consensus sequence shows an additional nucleotide change on top of the background genotype of A, B, and C, which was accrued over the process of transmission between individuals. In contrast, on the right that same pattern of diversity is present within individual A’s infection. Then, during a superspreading event in which A infects individuals B, C, and D directly, that within-host diversity is captured at the consensus level of the secondary infections. These toy trees are consistent with still more additional true transmission patterns that are not enumerated here. As an exercise you might want to try sketching additional possibilities out. Additionally, in much the same way that contextual data may change your understanding of linkage between cases, lacking sequences from infections may also change your interpretation of linkage. When assessing linkage between cases, we recommend keeping your sampling frame in mind. If you’re assessing linkage between two samples collected through representative surveillance, then consider what proportion of cases you have sequence data for. If you sequence only a small proportion of cases, then there may be intervening cases along a transmission chain that go unsequenced, and therefore do not appear in a phylogenetic tree. In that case, genetically-similar samples could be part of the same transmission chain, but not necessarily directly epidemiologically linked. Finally, some molecular epidemiological methods suggest using SNP distances and thresholds for ruling cases into the same outbreak or categorizing them as belonging to different outbreaks. While we understand how thresholds can make decision making easier, we generally discourage using SNP thresholds. This is because using SNP thresholds reduces the granularity of the data; they make a binary assessment (in or out of outbreak) when in fact the data are continuous (0, 1, 2, 3 … SNPs separating two sequences). While reducing the data down to a single binary outcome does make assessment easier, it does so by hiding nuance and uncertainty, which is critical for making epidemiologic inferences and assessing your confidence in them. Furthermore, making genetic distance into a binary call results in a loss of information. Pathogens accrue mutations at specific evolutionary rates, thus the actual count of differences between two sequences provides a quantitative estimate of how related or unrelated two sequences are. 5.1.6 Relevant case studies Ruling out a putative index case during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Are cases of the same Variant of Concern lineage linked? 5.2 Exploring relationships between cases of interest and other sequenced infections. 5.2.1 What kinds of questions fall into this topic? Is my outbreak linked to other outbreaks elsewhere? What other samples are closely related to my samples of interest? 5.2.2 Fundamental principles Exploring relationships between cases of interest and other sequenced infections relies on the same principles as discussed in the previous use case (Assessing linkage between cases). The reason that we have separated these concepts within this handbook is not because the principles underlying these concepts are different, but rather because the sequences you are considering in your analysis will likely come from different populations. In the previous use case, public health practitioners are seeking to use genomic epidemiology to understand epidemiologic relationships between individuals within their own community, or wherever they have jurisdiction. In contrast, in this use case we describe why and how to explore relationships between your samples of interest and sequenced infections from other communities and regions. 5.2.3 What kind of sampling do you need to answer the question? Within this broad use case, a question of interest centers around exploring possible links between your own cases (or outbreaks) and cases or outbreaks occurring in other communities. Contextualizing your own transmission in this way brings up a key concept and challenge; if you are looking for linkage with transmission in other contexts, then you want access to sequences that accurately capture the full scope of pathogen diversity circulating in those other contexts. This means that while you can select your own cases of interest in a way that aligns with the question you’re investigating, you typically need contextual data from other jurisdictions that has been sampled representatively. When sampled representatively, contextual data provide a more accurate summary of the circulating pathogen diversity in those other areas. When available sequence data from other regions accurately summarizes their own outbreaks, you can have greater confidence that you are accurately capturing the true presence or absence of cross-jurisdictional links. This concept brings forth a few important considerations. Firstly, the need for representatively sampled contextual data is one of the reasons why we need broad, baseline genomic surveillance programs. In such programs, sequencing is performed at random, without regard to specific clinical presentations, performance on diagnostic assays, or public health questions. Representative sequencing is done partially for the common good; everyone will need contextual data from other communities or populations at some point. This principle is why we encourage groups building genomic surveillance systems to perform some degree of representative sequencing beyond their targeted outbreak sequencing. Furthermore, this rationale is also why annotating those sequences as representatively sampled surveillance specimens is a critical part of genomic surveillance data management. 5.2.4 What tools or approaches can you use to answer the question? To answer these types of questions, we recommend phylogenetic approaches that summarize the genetic relationships between samples on a tree structure. Currently, there are two primary ways to infer a tree structure that includes your cases of interest: phylogenetic placements and phylogenetic trees. While the output of these two types of analyses may look similar, they are performing different processes. Each of these tree structures, as well as tools for performing phylogenetic placements and inferring phylogenetic trees, can be found in the “Tools and methods” chapter. As an additional layer to building a phylogenetic tree, genomic epidemiologists will frequently investigate cross-community outbreak linkage using phylogeography. Phylogeographic analyses take in geographic information about where sequences were sampled and probabilistically reconstruct where ancestral pathogens in the tree likely circulated. More information about phylogeography and implementing phylogeographic analyses is given in the “Tools and methods” chapter. 5.2.5 Caveats, limitations, and ways things go wrong While designing and maintaining representative sampling within your own jurisdiction can be challenging, influencing how sampling occurs externally is close to impossible. Variability in access to resources often leads to variability in which communities have pathogen genomic representation, which can directly impact your own inferences. While resourcing broad genomic surveillance programs at higher levels of jurisdictional authority (e.g. nationally) and clear annotation of representatively-collected data can mitigate this issue, the lack of control that you’ll generally have surrounding which contextual data actually exist publicly means that you should exercise some caution in interpreting your findings. This does not mean all is lost! For many investigations, genomic epidemiologists have simply analyzed whichever sequences existed or could be generated. And despite such non-ideal sampling, those analyses have still contributed greatly to our understanding of a pathogen’s epidemiology. We simply recommend recognizing that the data you have access to may be incomplete or biased, and that your interpretations may change upon the addition of more data. As the amount of publicly-available sequence data increases, you may find yourself shifting from including all contextual sequences that you can find to having to choose which contextual data to include. This will be true in particular for phylogenetic tree-based analyses, where there is a practical limit on the number of sequences you can include. For guidance on how to choose which contextual data to include, please refer to that section within the “Tools and methods” chapter. 5.2.6 Relevant case studies SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.620 case study. Evaluating an intake screening program to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to prisons. 5.3 Estimating the start and duration of an outbreak. 5.3.1 What kinds of questions fall into this topic? Our syndromic surveillance system isn’t as sensitive as we would like, and we aren’t sure how long we’ve had circulation of this pathogen in our community. When was this pathogen introduced into our community, and how long has it been circulating for? We received reports of some initial cases of a disease, but we weren’t able to confirm an outbreak until later. Did this outbreak begin around the time of those initial case reports? We had an outbreak in a congregate living facility, and we believe that we brought it under control, but we continue to have sporadic cases in the facility. Is the same outbreak still ongoing? 5.3.2 Fundamental principles Genomic data are useful for estimating the timing of epidemiologic events in a few different ways. Firstly, estimating the timing of disease circulation from genomic data can be more accurate when the disease in question causes large numbers of asymptomatic infections or mild cases that do not seek treatment. In these scenarios, surveillance systems may only start to record cases once a sufficient number of infections have occurred to produce a subset of more severe cases that seek care or diagnostic testing. In contrast, even when an infection is asymptomatic or mild, viral replication will occur, leading to mutations that may be carried forward during transmission. In this way, a record of the infection can be left in the pathogen genome even when the infection does not rise to a sufficiently symptomatic level to be a recorded case. Furthermore, since genomic data can enable you to resolve distinct but concurrent outbreaks, temporally-resolved phylogenetic trees can provide cluster-specific estimates of timing. This feature is particularly useful once you have ongoing transmission, and the emergence of distinct clusters (such as the emergence of a new variant) may not be apparent within an epidemiologic curve. In Chapter 3 we introduced molecular clocks, which represent the average rate at which a particular pathogen evolves. When we know on average the rate at which genetic diversity accumulates, we can take an observed amount of genetic diversity and ask: “How long would it have taken to accumulate this much diversity?” When we are looking at the genetic divergence between sequences sampled from the same outbreak or epidemic, calculating how much time was needed to generate that diversity provides an estimate of when that outbreak or epidemic likely started. We generally investigate this type of question using a temporally-resolved phylogenetic tree, and we frame the question as “What is the time to the most recent common ancestor of these sequences?” Or, “When did the most recent common ancestor of these sequences likely circulate?” When sequences are genetically similar, little evolutionary time has passed, and the ancestor from which those sequences are descended will be more recent. When sequences are very diverged, a large amount of evolutionary time has passed, and the ancestor of the sequences of interest will have existed further back in time. Every internal node within a phylogenetic tree represents an ancestor and will have an attached date. So, which internal node should you look at? Typically, the ancestral sequence that you are For example, if you are interested in estimating when an outbreak in a skilled nursing facility began, then the internal node that you would look for is the youngest node in the tree from which all SNF samples descend. Or if you are interested in when Zika virus likely arrived in the Americas, then you would look for the ancestral node from which all Zika virus genomes collected across all countries in the Americas descend. 5.3.3 What kind of sampling do you need to answer the question? In order to estimate the molecular clock accurately, you will need genome sequences collected over longer time spans. The reason for this is fairly simple; it is very hard to accurately estimate the slope of a line when the only data points you have come from a single cross-sectional sample. In contrast, data points collected over time allows you to see much more clearly how genetic diversity and time correlate, thereby providing more consistent and accurate estimates of the evolutionary rate. Ideally your serial samples used in estimating the molecular clock should be sampled representatively. These serially-sampled sequences can either be sequences you generated, or they can be publicly available contextual sequences. Once you have your estimate of the evolutionary rate, the samples of interest (whose ancestor you would like to date) can be sampled either representatively or in a targeted fashion, in accordance to your question of interest. If you are interested in when a localized outbreak began, then you may want to intensively sample and sequence infections that occur within that particular facility or setting. However, when the event that you would like to date has yielded many sequenced samples, it is best to sample the sequences representatively. For example, if I would like to estimate when SARS-CoV-2 was first introduced to California, I should select a representative sample of sequences from the entire state of California, and estimate when their ancestor likely circulated. While in theory I could perform targeted-sampling of the entire state of California and sequence every positive case, in reality that would be completely infeasible. Thus, to accurately estimate how much time was necessary for Californian viral diversity to accrue, I must have a representative sample of Californian SARS-CoV-2 diversity. If my sample is not representative, then the date that I infer will represent when the ancestor of the sample that I have. 5.3.4 What tools or approaches can you use to answer the question? Using the molecular clock to translate the branch lengths of trees from genetic divergence (evolutionary time) to calendar time is a fairly common method within genomic epidemiology. As such, there are various phylogenetic inference tools that you can use for building time trees. Given the rapid turnaround times that we typically desire in public health, Nextstrain analyses are currently the most common way of inferring time trees within public health contexts (see Tools and methods). Currently, phylogenetic placements do not allow you to make time trees. 5.3.5 Caveats, limitations, and ways things go wrong As discussed above, it is important that you always remember that you are inferring the timing of ancestors of your sampled sequences. Any pathogen genetic diversity that circulated in a population, but is not captured in your dataset, will not be included in your inferential procedure. This is why representative sampling of large populations is important to accurately estimating when transmission started. As a concrete example, imagine that you want to estimate when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged into the world. But also imagine we’re in the future, and the delta lineage of SARS-CoV-2 has completely taken over. All other variants that previously circulated (or currently circulate) go extinct. All you have left is delta lineage viruses, and viruses that descend from delta lineage ancestors. When building your dataset for the analysis of when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged, you download a representative sample of all publicly-available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the past 6 months. But you see that the estimated age of the root of that tree seems to be in spring of 2021, but you know that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating more than a year before that. What went wrong? All of the sequences in your theoretical analysis are delta-lineage descendents. In your large analysis, you have estimated when the ancestor of all of that delta-lineage diversity likely circulated, but that ancestor isn’t the same as the ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 diversity that ever existed. In order to estimate when SARS-CoV-2 originally emerged, you would need to ensure that you include sequences that represent the viral diversity that circulated before delta took over. An additional point to keep in mind is that molecular clocks vary depending on multiple factors (discussed in Chapter 3). Different datasets might give you slightly different estimates of rate of molecular evolution, and subsequently slightly different estimates of when ancestral viruses circulated. This variability is an inherent part of these analyses, and so we recommend always providing confidence intervals around your date estimates. When you see this variability, do not panic! If you estimate a faster evolutionary rate in a particular dataset it is unlikely that the pathogen is now suddenly evolving more quickly. The more likely explanation is that you have dense genomic sampling over a short time frame, meaning that purifying selection has not purged deleterious mutations from the pathogen population. Since there hasn’t been enough time for purifying selection to act, you’ll see more diversity and estimate a faster evolutionary rate. This scenario occurred during the epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa in 2013-2016. ADD IN FIGURE 5.3.6 Relevant case studies Estimating when the Zika Virus outbreak began in Colombia. 5.4 Assessing how demographic, exposure, and other epidemiological data relate to a genomically-defined outbreak. 5.4.1 What kinds of questions fall into this topic? Are different lineages of this virus circulating in younger people versus older people? Are different lineages of this virus circulating in vaccinated individuals versus unvaccinated individuals? I’m seeing multiple outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 across various different skilled nursing facilities in my jurisdiction. Are these outbreaks linked, and if so, how? 5.4.2 Fundamental principles Rather than relying on any specific principle within genomic epidemiology, this use case presents how one can bring inferences from genomic epidemiology together with surveillance or other epidemiological data. In doing these analyses, the user is looking at genomic relationships between samples, and overlaying those relationships with additional information about where cases lived or worked, their demographic information, possible exposure settings etc. This allows the user to qualitatively assess potential relationships between an exposure or demographic variable and clustering patterns in the tree. 5.4.3 What kind of sampling do you need to answer the question? You can bring together genomic and surveillance data across any kind of sample set, although you may find different utility in adding surveillance data to outbreaks sampled in a targeted way as compared to representatively-sampled surveillance samples. For example, if you are seeing multiple outbreaks across various skilled nursing facilities in your jurisdiction, you may wish to conduct dense, targeted sampling of cases among employees and residents of those various facilities. Then, you may wish to see how the facility that cases are associated with interacts with the genomic relationships you observe. Do individuals from a single SNF tend to cluster together in clades that are genetically diverged from cases in the other SNFs? Or do all the cases cluster together within a single clade, and adding data about which SNF a case came from shows that cases from all of the SNFs are highly intermingled? In this targeted-sampling example, you are interested in how an exposure of interest (SNF) is associated with close genetic relationships between infections. In contrast, when joining epidemiologic data and representatively-sampled genomic data, you may be less interested in exposure-outcome associations, and more interested in how well you are capturing a representative cross-section of your population. Adding demographic data to a tree can help you qualitatively see trends such as whether you’re capturing pathogen genetic diversity sampled only from urban centers, or from rural areas as well, and whether you’re capturing cases from different age groups and racial, ethnic, or national-origin groups. Doing this kind of procedure allows you to investigate whether you are likely capturing the full breadth of circulating viral diversity, or whether there is a population that appears to systematically lack genomic surveillance data. 5.4.4 What tools or approaches can you use to answer the question? One of the most common approaches for bringing together surveillance data with genomic data in public health applications is to use the “metadata overlay” feature in Nextstrain. This feature allows the user to color the tips of a Nextstrain tree visualized in Nextstrain Auspice according to additional variables specified in an external spreadsheet. One of the reasons why public health practitioners use this particular workflow is because it provides a way to join genomic data objects (the tree) with epidemiologic data, which often contains personally identifiable information or personal health information which epidemiologists must keep secure. This need for storing PII/PHI on secured computational infrastructure usually precludes it from being incorporated onto the tree directly, since bioinformaticians usually infer trees on scientific-computing infrastructure that is not authorized to store PII. In the case of the Nextstrain metadata overlay, the data table containing the surveillance data remains “client-side”, that is, the information never leaves the secure computer. Explicit instructions about how to format and use the Nextstrain metadata overlay are described in the Chapter 7: Tools and methods. 5.4.5 Caveats, limitations, and ways things go wrong What would an epidemiologic handbook be without at least one mention that correlation does not imply causation? In the case where you bring genomic and surveillance data together and look at how the exposure data relate to the phylogenetic patterns, you are in essence looking qualitatively for patterns of correlation between the surveillance data and the genomic data. To say that this is qualitative and correlative is not to undermine its utility; indeed, when brought together these data sources typically work synergistically to provide rich information regarding what transmission dynamics may be at play. However, as with any qualitative, observational analysis, the observed dynamics could be subject to confounding. As such, we recommend using this tool to derive quick situational awareness, and suggest that epidemiologists follow-up with more rigorous studies if the relationships observed warrant deeper investigation. 5.4.6 Relevant case studies Evaluating an intake screening program to prevent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to prisons.

These case studies illustrate step-by-step how different questions were investigated with a genomic epidemiological approach. Rather than providing the kinds of neat and cohesive narratives we frequently see in peer-reviewed literature, we have tried to show how hands-on investigations really proceed, including evaluating competing hypotheses and describing sources of uncertainty in our analyses. This chapter is pertinent to readers who will be directly involved in analyzing and interpreting genomic epidemiological studies, or who want to see examples of genomic epidemiology in practice. 6.1 Are cases of the same Variant of Concern lineage linked? At the beginning of 2021, public health authorities within the United States were concerned about the transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage (“Alpha” within the WHO nomenclature system), which appeared to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2. Already the dominantly-circulating lineage within the United Kingdom, public health agencies within the United States were interested in whether B.1.1.7 had already arrived in the United States, and if so, how it was distributed and at what frequency. Genomic surveillance activities were established and intensified to investigate these questions. Beyond estimating frequency, some public health agencies also monitored for individual cases infected with “Variant of Concern” lineages, which they might prioritize for more aggressive contact tracing and control efforts to limit the establishment and growth of VOC lineages within the jurisdiction. County A is a predominantly rural county, in which diagnostic testing and genomic surveillance are primarily handled by the local public health laboratory. The county started an in-house SARS-CoV-2 sequencing program at the beginning of 2021, and had regular sequencing and lineage assignment protocols in place during the spring of 2021, when they detected their first two cases of B.1.1.7 lineage-viruses among two residents of the county. The two cases were detected and sampled during the same week, a timeline that was consistent with one case infecting the other, resulting in an epidemiologically-linked pair. Beyond the timing of the two infections, epidemiological-linkage between the cases seemed possible since both cases were assigned the same lineage (B.1.1.7), and no other B.1.1.7 cases had been detected in County A up to this point. However, while Pango lineage assignments can provide a useful summary of different genetic lineages, most Pango lineages have genetic diversity within the lineage. Especially for lineages whose frequency grows significantly, such as B.1.1.7, there may be many different transmission chains of B.1.1.7 viruses circulating within different geographic areas. In such cases, phylogenetic analyses can provide higher resolution for refining relationships between cases. In response to these detections, County A undertook a rigorous analysis of the whole genome sequences from these two cases. Firstly, since these were the first B.1.1.7 cases detected in the county, County A wanted to verify the accuracy of the lineage calls. To do so, they looked at the .bam files, which show the actual sequencing read data mapped to a reference genome. To confirm the quality of the B.1.1.7 lineage defining SNP calls, they looked at the total number of reads that covered the lineage-defining site, and looked for the particular SNP call in each of the reads (Figure 6.1). This process was repeated for all B.1.1.7 defining sites. Figure 6.1: A zoomed in picture of site 23063 in the nucleotide sequence, where the reference sequence has an A and the sequencing reads show that this infection has a T at this site. The A23063T mutation in the nucleotide sequence corresponds to an N501Y substitution in Spike protein, which is one of multiple lineage defining mutations for B.1.1.7. At this site there are 390 distinct, high quality sequencing reads that support this call. Furthermore, both forward and reverse reads detect this nucleotide, further demonstrating that this call is real. Next, County A took the two confirmed B.1.1.7 lineage viruses and imported the sequences into Nextclade in order to assess their quality. The sequences showed minimal numbers of Ns, no mixed sites, and a reasonable number of mutations as compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (Figure 6.2). This indicates that the sequences are high quality, and appropriate for analysis. Notably, the sequences do have frameshift mutations in them, which is why the Nextclade F metric is red (Figure 6.2). While sometimes real, these frameshifts are often a bioinformatic artifact from the consensus genome assembly pipeline. While the author of a genome sequence will typically have to fix or document a frameshift for public repositories to accept the sequence, one can still use them in phylogenetic pipelines that “strip” these frameshifts away. Looking at the two sequences together in the Nextclade alignment viewer, we can see that both samples share some SNPs, as indicated by the colored bars (Figure 6.2). This makes sense since we know that both samples are B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. However, we can also see that there are differences between the two sequences as well (Figure 6.2). Each sample has numerous additional SNPs that are unique to the sample. This indicates that these samples are likely not directly related. The next paragraph will discuss that logic in more depth, and show how we can see that genetic divergence on the phylogenetic placement available in Nextclade. Figure 6.2: The two B.1.1.7 lineage viruses as visualized in Nextclade (sequence names are intentionally masked). Notably, all quality metrics show that the sequences are of high quality, except for the “F” metric, which indicates that a frameshift mutation has been detected. The sequence view shows that the two sequences share many SNPs, but also have some unique SNPs that are not found in the other sequence. In Nextclade we can take our two sequences and “graft” them onto a pre-inferred Nextstrain phylogeny in a process that is termed “phylogenetic placement”. The sequences are placed onto the tree according to the patterns of substitutions that the tree summarizes, and that your sequences have. The sequences of interest are placed onto the tree at the point where most of the SNPs in your genome sequence have also been observed in the tree. Then, any mutations that are unique to your sample, and not yet detected in the background tree, are shown as branch length leading from the tree to the sample of interest. In Figure 6.3A below, we can see that both sequences group in the Alpha lineage portion of the tree, consistent with their designation as B.1.1.7 lineage viruses. When we zoom in to the Alpha clade of the tree, we can see that despite both viruses receiving a B.1.1.7 assignment, they are quite diverged (Figure 6.3B). Indeed, these two B.1.1.7 sequences are separated by 13 SNPs (Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3B). This is much more genetic divergence than we would expect to see if the sequences were epidemiologically-linked. Figure 6.3: A) Nextclade phylogenetic placement of the two B.1.1.7 sequences onto a background Nextstrain tree. Nextclade places both of these sequences on the tree within the Alpha clade, consistent with the Pango lineage assignments and our visual assessment of the sequencing reads. B) A zoomed in view of the two sequences within the Alpha lineage of the tree shows that they are placed onto different parts of the tree within the Alpha clade. You can count the number of nucleotides changes separating the two viruses by “walking the path” of the highlighted branches between the two samples, counting up the number of nucleotide changes observed on each segment of the path as you go. An important note is that the vertical axis has no meaning, thus you are only summing up the number of SNPs observed along the horizontal branches. For an in-depth discussion of different thresholds of divergence, please see “Why sequencing is better at dismissing links than confirming them” in the Fundamental Theory chapter. However, we can also do a back-of-the envelope calculation to provide some context about what a 13 SNP difference means. Firstly, we should note that the average evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is roughly 24.5 substitutions across the entire genome per year (see Figure 6.4). This means that if we were to randomly sample two sequences that were sampled a year apart from each other, we would expect them on average to be 24.5 SNPs different from each other. If you were looking at the actual divergence between two sequences, the SNP difference counts would be whole numbers, but this rate is the average value if you were to repeat that sampling procedure many times over. If we take our two samples from County A that are separated by 13 SNPs and think about what this distance means in light of the evolutionary rate of the virus, we can say that roughly 6 months worth of transmission separates these two infections. Figure 6.4: The clock view from the global SARS-CoV-2 Nextstrain build maintained by the Nextstrain team. Each circle in this plot represents a sampled virus, the same as a tip in the tree, and the x and y positions in the plot are determined by the date the virus was sampled and the number of SNPs that it has compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome respectively. The evolutionary rate estimate comes from the slope of a least-squares line fit through the data points. What does this mean from a public health standpoint? County A can be confident that these two cases are not linked - the genome sequences are too diverged for that to be likely. Thus, these two cases of B.1.1.7 more likely represent independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the county. This means that these two cases do not represent a transmission event of B.1.1.7 within County A. Rather, these two cases were likely separately infected somewhere else outside the county, and then returned home where they were tested for COVID-19. At this point, case interviews could be helpful for discerning whether these cases recently traveled, or what exposure event may have led them to contract a lineage that had not previously been detected in County A. Furthermore, since these two cases do not represent sustained transmission within the county, aggressive contact tracing efforts might be warranted in order to prevent establishment of B.1.1.7 circulation in the county. 6.2 Evaluating an intake screening program to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to prisons. County C has a large jail housing a considerable number of pre-trial detainees. Given the challenge of controlling SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, including prisons, public health officials in County C implemented a screening system for COVID-19. The jail had experienced previous outbreaks, and the intent of this screening program was to prevent new introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the jail, which could seed further outbreaks. As part of the screening program, newly incarcerated individuals were tested for COVID-19 if they consented, and underwent a two week quarantine period prior to being moved into the standard housing units. The jail recorded cases across multiple residential pods. Given the duration of time over which cases were observed, and the fact that multiple residential pods appeared to be affected, epidemiologists were interested in what processes were contributing to COVID-19 cases within the jail. Was the intake quarantine program ineffective, in which case newly-admitted persons were introducing SARS-CoV-2 into the jail? Or had a previous outbreak within the jail never fully ended? Given the ability of pathogen genomic sequence data to differentiate between related and unrelated cases, investigators sequenced samples from cases who tested positive during their intake screening quarantine period, and from cases that were detected within the residential pods of the jail. Five sequences were collected from individuals who had tested positive during intake quarantine, and twenty-one sequences were collected from individuals who tested positive while residing in the jail. All of the sequences were assigned the same Pango lineage, thus the lineage information did not provide sufficient information to discern relationships between the samples. Therefore, investigators took these sequences and performed a phylogenetic analysis of jail sequences alongside contextual sequence data that had been collected from County C and other locales through representative surveillance sampling. The genetic divergence tree in Figure 6.5 below shows the clade grouping 26 sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals (jail sequences are in yellow, contextual data are in grey). Looking at that clade we can see a few important findings. Firstly, some of the jail sequences are genetically diverged, and are more closely related to contextual sequences sampled from the broader community than they are to other sequences collected from incarcerated individuals. Secondly, there is one clade in which samples from the jail have identical consensus genome sequences and sequences that are very closely related to each other. Knowing that genetically-similar infections are more likely to be linked to each other, and that genetically-dissimilar infections are likely unrelated, we can surmise from this tree that some of these cases likely constitute an outbreak, while other cases among incarcerated individuals represent community-acquired infections that are not part of the outbreak. Figure 6.5: Phylogenetic tree of jail sequences and representatively-sampled contextual sequences. A) The top panel of this figure shows the clade within which all jail sequences group with other contextual sequences. Contextual sequences are shown in grey while jail sequences are coloured yellow. In this view you can see the broad distribution of some jail sequences across the entire clade, as well as one cluster of jail sequences which appear closely genetically-related. B) A zoomed-in view of the clade which clusters many jail sequences together. Many of the jail sequences within this cluster have identical genome sequences, and therefore appear stacked vertically along the root node of the outbreak clade. We see other jail sequences within this cluster that appear to have one or two additional nucleotide mutations. Knowing that not all of these cases are genetically-related is the first step in evaluating the intake screening program. However, this information alone is not sufficient. What we really want to see is which of these 26 sequences come from cases detected during intake screening, and which cases come from incarcerated individuals living in the residential pods. To combine the genomic picture with this epidemiologic data, we can make use of the functionality in Nextstrain that allows us to overlay additional surveillance data onto a tree. In Figure 6.6 below, we’ve overlaid the phylogenetic tree with a tsv file that maps “case status” (either inmate or intake screening) to the “strain name” of the sequence in the Nextstrain tree. This allows us to then color the tree according to this new field. In the tree below, we can see that sequences from cases found during intake screening are colored in yellow, while cases detected within the jail are colored in blue. Figure 6.6: Metadata overlay onto Nextstrain phylogenetic tree differentiates sequences from incarcerated individuals (inmates) and from intake screening. On the left hand side of this figure is a screenshot of the metadata file formatted such that it can be dragged and dropped onto the tree. On the right, we see the same cluster as shown in Figure 6.5, but now jail sequences are coloured according to whether they were sampled from incarcerated individuals residing in pods (blue) or from individuals undergoing intake screening (yellow). Contextual sequences remain coloured in grey. This picture helps us understand the following. Firstly, cases detected through the intake screening program are not genetically-related to cases that were detected within the jail’s residential pods. This means that the observed transmission within the jail’s residential units was not initiated by any of the sequenced positive cases detected during intake screening. Secondly, intake cases are genetically similar to sequences sampled representatively from surrounding communities. This result supports a scenario in which newly admitted individuals were infected prior to their intake, with those infections discovered during the quarantine period. Thirdly, sequenced cases from intake screening are terminal tips in the tree. By that, we mean that there are no sequences in the tree that descend from infections detected during intake screening. This means that the quarantine period halted onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, within the clade grouping all sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals living in the residential pods, we see that twelve cases are infected with an identical genotype that is basal to other related genotypes detected among the incarcerated individuals residing in pods (Figure 6.7). Additional samples from incarcerated individuals show additional substitutions accrued on top of the basal genotype. While some of this diversity could represent the transmission of within-host diversity during a super-spreading event, it is also consistent with substitutions accruing over the course of multiple transmission events. The latter scenario, that the accrued genetic diversity is the result of ongoing circulation within the jail, is more likely given that the cases among incarcerated individuals were detected over multiple months. Figure 6.7: Phylogenetic tree showing the outbreak within the residential pods of the jail. Twelve sequences sampled from incarcerated individuals in the residential pods show identical genome sequences, and are the basal genotype of this clade. There are five contextual sequences that also have this identical genotype. Further investigation of which cases these contextual sequences were sampled from may provide some information regarding how this outbreak was introduced to the jail. Three sequences have an additional unique nucleotide mutation, and one sequence has an additional two nucleotide mutations that are unique to that sample. At the top of this clade we see an additional clade that groups 4 jail samples that all share one additional nucleotide mutation on top of the basal sequence. This pattern of unique and shared diversity, in conjunction with the timeframe over which these samples were collected, suggests ongoing circulation of this clade within the jail over time. In terms of public health policy, these findings indicate that the intake screening program is serving its intended effect, namely, preventing new introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the jail. While it is unclear how the outbreak was introduced into the prison, the most cases within the incarcerated population appear to be related to ongoing transmission within the jail, and thus interventions should focus on controlling transmission within the jail and its residential pods. 6.3 Identifying, assigning, and investigating a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Lithuania Many countries started or expanded their existing sequencing programmes following the announcement of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (pango nomenclature) aka alpha (WHO nomenclature) lineage in late December 2020. At the time, the pandemic had been in its first year of circulation in humans and numerous lineages had acquired sufficient mutations to be easily told apart by sequencing, some of the mutations seemingly being selected by high seroprevalence rates in some countries. One striking feature of this diversity had been the same mutations arising independently in multiple lineages, suggesting that similar solutions to common evolutionary pressures were arising in the virus population. In this case study we will examine lineage B.1.620, a globally rare lineage with a striking constellation of mutations and deletions most of which had been seen in individual variants of concern (VOCs) at the time, but not in combination and without evidence of recombination. We will examine the circumstances under which lineage B.1.620 was discovered, how its origins were determined despite limited data, and how to navigate the landscape of competing hypotheses using phylogenetics. The Lithuanian SARS-CoV-2 sequencing programme, organised by the National Public Health Laboratory and started in February 2021, employed the sequencing capacity of domestic hospitals and universities, as well as the resources of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) reference laboratory. At the time, the programme’s maximum capacity enabled sequencing of ~700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per week. With this degree of sequencing performed on representatively-sampled specimens, and given the SARS-CoV-2 incidence at the time, this level of sequencing should have been sufficient to detect lineages that represented 0.36% of the cases (0.0036 is the upper 95% binomial confidence interval using Jeffrey’s method at 0 detections out of 700 samples). During the study period described here, the predominant lineages in Lithuania were B.1.1.7 (designated as alpha in WHO VOC nomenclature) and B.1.177.60, a Lithuanian sublineage of B.1.177 which itself is of Spanish origin and came to dominate in much of Europe in late 2020 due to holiday-goers visiting Spain in summer of 2020 (Hodcroft et al. 2021). Sequencing results arriving on the week of April 5 2021 included the typical mixture of predominant B.1.1.7 and B.1.177.60 lineages, with two genomes designated as B.1.177.57 by pango, but which unusually included the amino acid change E484K in the S protein of the virus. These two unusual genomes were also flagged by nextclade as having too many private mutations (i.e. mutations that are not shared with any others in the tree) while their placement on a bigger phylogenetic tree using strict similarity implied that these two sequences could not possibly be B.1.177.57 because they fell in a completely different part of the tree than even basal lineage B.1.177. This mismatch highlighted the differences between methods of classification used by pangolin and by nextclade. As a machine learning-based approach, pangolin cannot cope well with out-of-sample prediction (that is, identify lineages it hasn’t seen before) and its underlying decision tree architecture made it sensitive to classify what should be distinct lineages as the same based on shared repeat mutations. Nextclade, on the other hand, attempts to place each SARS-CoV-2 genome query on a reference tree by identifying nodes whose sequence is most similar to a query. Based on the mutations, the two new unusual sequences could not possibly be derived from B.1.177 and known methodological differences between pangolin and nextclade made it clear that pangolin was in error. In nextclade nomenclature, the two new unusual sequences were designated as belonging to clade 20A, corresponding to pango lineage B.1, a basal and diverse SARS-CoV-2 genotype. We will refer to this lineage as lineage X until its official designation in the story. Figure 6.8: Spike protein changes and nextclade warnings of the two mystery genomes. Because the reference tree has been updated since these genomes were described, private mutation warnings are not as extreme as they were at the time of discovery. To better understand this new and unusual lineage X, its constellation of mutations and deletions was examined. Most prominent amongst the mutations present was E484K in the Spike protein, which had been predicted early in the epidemic to have a significant impact on neutralising antibody titres raised against lineages without this mutation. Other mutations and deletions found in lineage X were known from other VOCs: ORF1a: 3675/3677Δ (highly convergent deletion in multiple VOCs), S: P26S (found in P.1), S: 69/70del (found in B.1.1.7), S: 144/145del (found in B.1.1.7), S: 241/243del (found in B.1.351), S: H245Y, S: S477N, S: E484K (all found in B.1.351, P.1), S: P681H (found in B.1.1.7), S: T1027I (found in P.1), S: D1118H (found in B.1.1.7), and N: A220V (found in B.1.177 and likely responsible for incorrect pango classification of lineage X as B.1.177.57). GISAID, the de facto global repository of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, allows the user to carry out simple queries for genomes in the database. Many of the mutations that lineage X carried were already set up as possible mutation queries because of other VOCs, and it was possible to use combinations of mutations that had not been seen in any other lineage together. Figure 6.9: Mutations unique to the mystery lineage X (which became B.1.620) are shown in red, blue highlights amino acid changes present in other VOCs and VOIs of the time. Searching GISAID for genomes that carried mutations S: E484K, S: S477N, and S: 69/70del identified 40-odd additional genomes that also carried the remaining constellation of mutations and deletions characteristic of lineage X. Two cases of lineage X from mid-March were retrospectively identified on GISAID in this way which were missed initially because of pango misclassification. Other genomes on GISAID were submitted by labs sequencing in Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, UK, and Spain. All genomes available at the time were one or more mutations away from the common ancestor genotype, none clustered strongly according to country, and lineage X was not dominant in any of the countries where it was detected. If the origin location of this lineage had an intensive sequencing programme, their sequence data would likely detect certain features, such as high prevalence of lineage X within the origin region, evidence of lineage’s gradual evolution and/or rise to higher frequency after originating (for example, shown by a phylogenetic pattern where genotypes detected in the origin region sit roughly basal to diversity seen elsewhere). None of the countries where lineage X had been found at the time fit any of these features, strongly suggesting that the actual origin location was not represented by the sequences on GISAID. Figure 6.10: Early lineage X genomes collected from different countries in Europe. Known travel cases are indicated with outlines corresponding to country of origin. This suspicion was strengthened by the identification of one lineage X genome on GISAID from France that came from an infected traveler coming to France from Cameroon. Authors of other lineage X sequences on GISAID were contacted personally by email to inquire about potential travel histories of patients from whom lineage X had been sequenced. Of the authors who reported back information, a surprisingly large number of lineage X genomes (around 10) had been collected from travelers coming from Cameroon to Switzerland, France, and Belgium. Some authors could not provide travel information because their organisations had deemed travel information to be sensitive and personally identifiable information. Personal information protection is an important and sensitive topic in genomic epidemiology, and there are varied opinions and regulations defining what counts as personally identifying information. These challenges can make collating the same information fields from multiple sources challenging or impossible. As more information was being pursued, an official pango lineage designation was requested for lineage X. The nomenclature system devised by the Pango Network to refer to distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages has been extremely helpful for communication between scientists. With an official designation of lineage X as B.1.620, it was possible for personnel used to just looking at lineage composition to notice this unusual lineage, which would otherwise be assigned a different lineage. The designation also gave researchers around the world common vocabulary to discuss this lineage without having to refer to all of its mutations and deletions. An unexpected benefit of an official designation was that it tempered headlines in national and international media that referred to lineage B.1.620 (prior to designation) as an “unidentified coronavirus strain”, a needlessly ominous term likely to grab attention and add to confusion when communicating with the public later. Figure 6.11: Healthcare emergencies can be accompanied by unhelpful attention from media outlets. The already strong case for an African origin of lineage B.1.620, due to the lineage’s association with travelers arriving from Cameroon, became even stronger with the help of African collaborators. Scientists working in the Central African Republic (CAR) near the border with Cameroon shared six B.1.620 genomes, at last confirming that B.1.620 actually circulated in the region. As more African countries began or expanded sequencing programmes, B.1.620 was eventually found in CAR, Cameroon, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Angola. While most travelers infected with B.1.620 had arrived from Cameroon, CAR turned out to have the highest frequency of B.1.620, despite low numbers of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Neighbouring Republic of the Congo turned out to have the second highest frequency of lineage B.1.620 in the world, though sequencing data showed up very late. Figure 6.12: To date the highest frequency of B.1.620 genomes are observed in central Africa. All of the evidence together suggests that lineage B.1.620 arrived to Europe from Cameroon on multiple occasions but CAR is more likely to have been the location where B.1.620 became a dominant variant, if not its birthplace. This highlights an important aspect of sequence data, namely that all available information should be brought to bear when interpreting sequence data. Another issue that plagued the B.1.620 investigation were sequencing errors and assembly artefacts. Sequencing labs often have variable access to the tools and expertise necessary for assembling high quality genomes, and this can result in variable sequence quality. One of the labs submitting B.1.620 genomes to GISAID, for example, were able to recover genomes containing all the mutations expected of the lineage, but did not include the deletions. It would be extremely unlikely to sample a precursor lineage to B.1.620 in Europe which happened to have only the mutations but not the deletions typical of the lineage. A far more parsimonious explanation was that the reference-based assembly method used by the lab did not handle indels (insertion and deletion changes) well. Sequences like these were excluded from analyses because the presence or absence of indels altered their phylogenetic placement. Another intriguing case was found in Lithuanian data where a genome occupying an intermediate position along the long branch leading to all known B.1.620 genomes was discovered weeks into the B.1.620 outbreak in the country. At face value the interpretation of such phylogenetic placement is that B.1.620 evolved in Lithuania. Given the intensity of Lithuania’s genomic surveillance programme, and convincing evidence that B.1.620 had come from central Africa, the sample was inspected in greater detail. The genome itself contained mutations typical of B.1.620 but other sites with non-reference nucleotides contained mutations typical of lineage B.1.177.60. At this point there were two hypotheses; either this was a recombinant sequence or a co-infection. As we discuss in greater detail in the Recombination section of the the Further concepts chapter, some of the key signals the recombination leaves were missing from this sample. For example, the mosaic pattern was only observed in this single sample. Furthermore, the actual pattern of the mosaic pattern of mutations, where B.1.620-like and B.1.177.60-like mutations occurred randomly across the entire genome, did not indicate recombination. Rather, bona fide recombinants observed in the UK had patterns of mosaic mutations that clustered towards one or the other end of the genome. To conclusively rule-in co-infection, the assembly files were investigated, specifically the frequencies of each non-reference nucleotide. All non-reference nucleotides for that sample had a nearly 50-50 split in frequencies between B.1.620-like and B.1.177.60-like alleles, exactly as expected from co-infection. Calling a consensus sequence from this read data, particularly when the two alternative alleles are so close in frequency, results in the mosaic we saw initially. This sequence was subsequently removed from databases and excluded from future analyses. Figure 6.13: Screenshot of a nextstrain build showing an early-branching sample (bottom) from Lithuania. This early branching sample had only some of the mutations found in B.1.620, implying that it diverged from a lineage that eventually gave rise to B.1.620, an impossibility considering all the evidence pointing to central Africa as the region from which B.1.620 reached Europe. This sample was later identified as an incorrectly assembled genome from a co-infection case with B.1.177.60 and B.1.620 lineages. An overarching lesson from B.1.620 is that, while sequencing data can provide a wealth of information, you shouldn’t interpret it in isolation from all other information you may have. Sequencing error, incorrectly labeled genomes, incorrectly annotated metadata, sequence classification tools, etc can all result in either individual or sets of observations that seemingly go against a developing hypothesis. It is therefore key to integrate as many sources of information as possible into a genomic epidemiological investigation, such that the entirety of the body of evidence is cohesive with the sequence data. And it’s good to retain skepticism of sequence data that don’t conform, since sequence data issues often leave imprints that are easy to diagnose. 6.4 Estimating when the Zika Virus epidemic began in Colombia. Zika virus frequently causes asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases, which means that syndromic surveillance systems may not necessarily capture the initial few cases when Zika virus begins circulating in a new region. This issue is compounded by the fact that many other arboviral infections that circulate in South America, such as Chikungunya virus and Dengue virus, cause similar symptoms upon infection. Thus even if syndromic surveillance systems capture an uptick in febrile illness, this may be attributed to different viral diseases, which again may obscure Zika virus circulation. Indeed, multiple genomic epidemiological studies of Zika virus circulation in the Americas demonstrate that Zika virus was circulating for months, even up to a year, before detection by syndromic surveillance systems. Why do we need to accurately date when Zika virus circulation began occurring? Firstly, this information builds our descriptive epidemic understanding of the outbreak, which is critical to informing which analytical epidemiological studies we may want to design. For example, when investigating whether Zika virus infection was related to severe sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly, one of the sources of evidence for an association was a higher incidence of these sequelae when Zika virus infections were occurring (compared to baseline incidence rates when Zika virus was not circulating). Accurately knowing when Zika virus was circulating in a country, and therefore when individuals were at risk for Zika virus infection, is critical for selecting the correct time period for ascertaining baseline rates and ensuring the validity of such investigations. Secondly, when mounting evidence suggested that Zika infection during pregnancy was associated with microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, many countries began designing cohort studies to study the association in a more controlled manner, and registries to provide supportive care and monitoring to families who might potentially be impacted by a Zika virus infection. In order to enroll participants in a valid way, you need to know who was at risk of Zika virus infection during pregnancy, which requires accurately knowing when Zika virus was circulating. If you underestimate the duration of time when Zika virus infections were occurring, you may errantly omit individuals from cohort studies and registries who should really be included. So, how do we actually estimate when Zika virus circulation began? The first step is to build a temporally-resolved phylogenetic tree. Here, the dataset that we use matters. Since we are interested in understanding when Zika virus arrived in Colombia, we first need to have a representative sample of the Zika virus diversity that circulated in Colombia during the Colombian epidemic. Additionally, we need contextual sequence data from other countries in the Americas that experienced Zika virus epidemics. Including sequence data from other countries has two important purposes. The first is that it allows us to see how Colombian viruses are related to other Colombian viruses and to viruses sampled from other countries in the Americas. This allows us to differentiate between distinct Zika virus introductions to Colombia, and to see where those seeding events likely came from. Secondly, the inclusion of Zika sequences sampled through time from other countries ensures that we have a strong pattern of sequences available across many time points. This serial sampling enables accurate inference of the rate of evolution, which is directly related to our estimates of when Zika arrived in different countries, which is our question of interest here. Figure 6.14: A) A temporally-resolved phylogeny of 360 whole Zika virus genome sequences, of which only 20 are sampled from Colombia. This tree was inferred using Nextstrain. The tips and branches are coloured according to the country where they were sampled from, or the inferred country of circulation, respectively. B) The same phylogeny as shown in the A, but with only Colombian samples highlighted. While they are pushed together in the same area of the tree, there are two distinct clades of Colombian sequences. These are annotated as Clade 1 and Clade 2. This shows that there are two different pools of Zika viral diversity circulating in Colombia. Viruses in one pool are more closely related to viruses from another country in the Americas than they are to viruses from the other Colombian pool. This pattern suggests that these two clades of Colombian Zika virus were separately introduced to the county. C) A root-to-tip plot showing the estimated evolutionary rate of Zika virus given the samples analyzed here. Note the presence of sampling over time, including viral genomes sampled from French Polynesia in 2014 and from multiple countries in the Americas from 2015 through 2017. Each virus is like a snapshot of diversity at a moment in time. By looking at those snapshots over broad windows of time, we can more accurately measure the rate at which nucleotide changes are accumulating. You’ll note that these trees might look slightly different than ones that you have made previously. Beyond having the tips coloured by country, the branches are also coloured according to country as well. This colouring is made possible by running phylogeography in Nextstrain. Briefly, phylogeography will allow you to infer the most probable region where an ancestral virus (an internal node in the tree) likely circulated. When combined with the temporal resolution of a time tree, you can see when a geographic migration event likely occurred by looking at the estimated dates of when ancestral viruses circulated in different regions. For example, in Figure 6.15 below, we are showing one of the two clades of Zika virus that circulated in Colombia (and seeded transmission into other countries as well). We can get an estimate of when Zika moved into Colombia by looking at when the internal nodes in the tree change from likely circulating in Brazil to likely circulating in Colombia. Figure 6.15: A zoomed in view of the larger Colombian clade of Zika virus within the same tree that we have been using during this case study. We have annotated two internal nodes: the most basal internal node that we infer circulated in Colombia, and then the direct parent node which we infer circulated in Brazil. This gives us a time range: on one side we have an idea of when Zika virus was likely still circulating in Brazil, and on the other end we have an idea of when Zika was likely circulating in Colombia. Therefore, the movement event from Brazil into Colombia occurred sometime between those two bounds, but we do not know exactly when. Notably, there is uncertainty on the dates for both internal nodes, which in Nextstrain are given as 95% confidence intervals around the inferred date. Capturing this uncertainty is important, since the molecular clock is an average rate that can change depending on the dataset, and the inferred dates on internal nodes can also change given the inclusion of more or less data. Notably, there are sources of uncertainty here that you should consider depending on how you seek to use the timing estimates. Firstly, there is uncertainty in the dates assigned to internal nodes. Therefore, you should always report the 95% confidence interval around the dates, and not just the point estimate. Secondly, the dates assigned to internal nodes can shift, and confidence intervals around the point estimates can widen or shrink, depending on the dataset you use. This wobble in the estimates is normal, and will come from slight changes in the evolutionary rate when different sequences are included in the dataset, and from different amounts of data clustering together within the clade for which you are trying to date the parent internal node. Typically, the more samples you have within the clade, the more precise your date estimate will be. Secondly, it’s important to remember that, without more advanced phylodynamic approaches, you will not be able to exactly infer when a geographic migration rate occurred along a branch. Rather, you will only have estimates of when an ancestral virus likely circulated in one region, and then when a child virus likely circulated in a different region. This means that you have point estimates and measurements of uncertainty on the bounds of when a migration event occurred, but you do not know exactly when that migration event occurred. In cases where there is minimal genomic sampling, and you observe long branches, it will be challenging to nail down when migration occurred (see example in Figure 6.16 below). Finally, when combining dating with phylogeographic approaches, it’s important to remember that the phylogeographic reconstruction will not capture any transmission through countries that lack genome sequences. Thus, in addition to showing us the challenges with getting bounds on dates, Figure 6.16 below also shows us how limited genomic surveillance can hamper our understanding of where an introduction came from. In Figure 6.16, we see that the inferred ancestral sequence likely circulated in Brazil, and roughly 2 years later we find that a strain descended from that node was sampled in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). In this case it is highly unlikely that we have a direct transmission event from Brazil to the United States Virgin Islands. The more likely scenario is that this particular lineage of Zika virus migrated up through other countries that lacked genomic sampling, meaning that the lineage’s trip up to the USVI was not sampled, and cannot be recorded in the tree. Figure 6.16: This figure shows a clade grouping multiple sequences sampled from Brazil, and one sequence sampled from the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). Note that close to two years of transmission separates the most basal ancestral node of this clade (which we infer circulated in Brazil) from when the viral strain was sampled in the USVI. It is highly unlikely that this is a direct migration from Brazil to the USVI. Rather, this finding likely occurs due to lack of genomic sampling of the epidemic as this lineage moved from Brazil through other countries before ending up in the USVI. Since we have no genomic sampling of that intervening transmission, we cannot see it in the tree, and we end up with a very, very long branch leading to an infection sampled in the USVI. In this case, the bounds on the timing of that introduction into the US Virgin Islands are so wide as to be essentially uninformative. This is a classic example of why genomic epidemiological analyses benefit greatly from consistent and representative genomic surveillance performed by all areas experiencing pathogen transmission. Secondly, it is also highly unlikely that this represents a direct transmission event from Brazil into the United States Virgin Islands.

Since this handbook is narrowly focused on applied genomic epidemiological analysis, this chapter focuses on easily-deployable and fast tools for performing comparative analysis of multiple genome sequences. We do not discuss bioinformatic approaches for generating consensus genomes from sequencing read data, nor will we elaborate deeply on methods and tools used primarily in academic settings for genomic epidemiological analysis. This chapter is most pertinent for readers who will be performing genomic epidemiological analysis themselves. 7.1 Phylogenetic placements Phylogenetic placements are named as such since they place your samples of interest onto a previously-inferred, fixed phylogenetic tree. To do this, placement methods summarize the sequences of interest according to the nucleotide changes they carry compared to a reference sequence representing the root of the tree. This tree contains information about which mutations occurred along different branches in the tree. The sequences of interest are then placed into the “optimal” position on the tree according to the mutations that the samples of interest have and how those mutations are summarized by the tree. The optimal placement may be calculated differently when using different placement methods. While there are multiple methods for assessing the quality of the placement, the tools that genomic epidemiologists currently use most frequently determine the optimal placement by means of parsimony. The most parsimonious placement of a sequence onto the tree is the one that requires the least number of additional mutations in the sequence beyond the genetic changes summarized in the tree. Notably, there may be multiple placements of a sequence onto a tree that require the same number of additional changes, and thus have the same parsimony score. Under this framework, these placements represent equally likely placements on the tree. The number of equally likely placements thereby provides a measure of uncertainty in the placement. If there are many equally probable placements then we are uncertain which placement is the “true” placement. If the number of equally probable placements is low, then we can be relatively confident in the placement position. There are currently two commonly-used tools for performing phylogenetic placements of SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Nextclade and UShER. While both tools perform a phylogenetic placement, the phylogenies that Nextclade and UShER place samples of interest upon are different. This means that the way the output looks will be different, and what you can learn from one program may be more challenging to learn from the other. We recommend trying out and getting comfortable with both programs, as sometimes the UShER output is most informative, while other times the cohesive picture provided by Nextclade may be more helpful. 7.1.1 UShER UShER will take your sequences of interest and place them on a megatree built from all SARS-CoV-2 sequences available from various public repositories (e.g. GISAID, NCBI GenBank, COG-UK data etc). In this way, UShER enables you to compare the genetic similarity of your samples to all other sequences available in the public repository of your selection. UShER finds the n (where you set n) most closely related samples to your own samples of interest, and places your sample onto a small “subtree” showing the relationship between your samples and the other genetically similar sequences. This capacity is particularly useful when you want to know what sequences your samples of interest are most closely related to. When your samples of interest are highly genetically similar they will frequently end up on the same subtree. However, if your samples are not genetically similar, UShER will provide multiple subtrees for each of the samples, showing your sample of interest’s placement among other publicly-available genome sequences that were genetically similar to your sample of interest. When you run UShER, the program will return a table of metrics that summarize the placement (see Figure 7.1 for an example). These metrics will provide some information about the genome sequence that you placed (e.g. how long it was, how many insertions or deletions the genome had, how many N’s the sequence had etc.). The table also provides information about the placement, including how many mutations (SNVs) the sequence had that UShER used to place the sample, which sample is the most closely related to the sample of interest, the number of maximally parsimonious placements UShER found, and the parsimony score. Of these, the number of maximally parsimonious placements and the parsimony score are some of the best metrics for understanding your placement. As discussed in the introduction to phylogenetic placements, the number of maximally parsimonious placements provides a rough measure of certainty. If there are many parsimonious placements, then you can’t take any one of the subtrees as the “true placement”. The parsimony score will tell you how many additional mutations were in your sequence beyond the mutations observed in other sequences and summarized by the tree. The larger the parsimony score, the more diverged your sequence is from other sequences found in public repositories. When looking at the subtree, you’ll see that this parsimony score will be equal to the branch length observed between the tree and the sequence of interest. For example, in Figure 7.2 the red branch leading to hypothetical_uploaded_sequence_1 is 3 nucleotides long, and that matches the parsimony score of 3 that you can see in Figure 7.1. Figure 7.1: A screenshot from UShER showing the first entry in the UShER summary table for the hypothetical uploaded sequences that UShER provides. When you are on the website, you can hover over each of the column headers to learn more about them. You can see that metrics are given, and the cells are coloured according to a quality assessment. Note that while the table view in UShER will provide the name of a sequence entry that was most closely related to your sample of interest, there could be multiple sequences that have identical genome sequences to whichever sequence shows up in the table as the “Neighboring sample in the tree.” You can see an example of this in Figure 7.2. In the table view (Figure 7.1), you can see that the Neighboring sample in tree for hypothetical_uploaded_sequence_1 is USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020 | MW190437.1 | 2020-03-17. However, when you look at the tree in Figure 7.2, you see that USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020 is one sample among many that have identical genome sequences, and thus stack vertically in the tree. This means that USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020 is as close of a neighbor to hypothetical_uploaded_sequence_1 as any other of the sequences in the subtree that have identical genome sequences as USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020. Figure 7.2: The subtree for hypothetical_uploaded_sample_1 that is linked in the last column of the UShER summary table. You can see that two more of the uploaded hypothetical samples are most closely related to hypothetical_uploaded_sample_1, and so these show up on the subtree as well. You can also see that there are many different samples that have the identical genome sequence to USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020. All of the samples with identical genome sequences to USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020 are as similarly related to hypothetical_uploaded_sample_1 as USA/MN-QDX-1663/2020 is, so in this case you should exercise caution in your interpretation. 7.1.2 Nextclade Nextclade will take in your sequences and perform some quality assessment on the consensus genomes. You can then also place the sequences onto a background Nextstrain tree, either a globally-diverse phylogeny that is available by default within Nextclade, or some other previously-inferred Nextstrain tree that you supply. The Nextclade phylogenetic placement has the benefit of showing a fuller picture of viral evolutionary history leading up to where Nextclade places your sample of interest. Additionally, the Nextclade placement will place all of your samples of interest onto the same background tree, allowing you to see their placements together. However, Nextclade does not include any contextual data beyond the background tree, thus sequences near to your sample of interest in the placement may not be the most genetically similar sequences to your sample of interest. This is a key difference in interpretation between the Nextclade placement and the UShER placement. Figure 7.3: A Nextclade phylogenetic placement of 14 hypothetical samples. In contrast to the UShER subtree that we saw above, you can see the placement of all of these samples onto a single background tree, even though some of these samples are highly divergent. This provides a nice overview of the diversity of your sequences. However, this placement won’t tell you which sequences are most closely related to your uploaded sequences. 7.2 Phylogenetic trees There are two commonly used methods of tree inference: distance-matrix methods and maximum likelihood methods. Distance-matrix methods take pairwise distances between all aligned sequences and aim to reconstruct a graph that represents similarities between samples. The distance matrix methods that you’ll see most commonly implemented in phylogenetic inference software are “neighbor-joining” and sometimes “UPGMA” (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean). While neighbour-joining performs better than UPGRAM, we avise generally avoiding distance matrix methods altogether because the trees recovered by these algorithms are representations of the similarity between the samples, rather than an explicit model of how the sequences have evolved. Distance matrix methods, however, are very fast for very large trees (with hundreds of samples thousands of nucleotides long), which is why you might see them used in some cases. In contrast, maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods are more rigorous methods for inferring phylogenetic trees because they explicitly model the evolution of sequences. Thus, ML and Bayesian trees reflect the plausible relationships between sequences much better. Both ML and Bayesian methods take a long time to run on larger datasets because, unlike distance matrix methods which algorithmically cluster sequences by similarity and always give the same tree, ML and Bayesian methods search the space of all possible trees for either the single best tree or the set of most probable trees, respectively. That said, due to their popularity, ML methods have been iteratively improved with various approximations that make them run faster (RAxML and FastTree are examples). Below, we outline some of the most common tools we see used in practice for inferring ML and Bayesian phylogenetic trees for applied genomic epidemiology. Notably, there are numerous tools for inferring phylogenetic trees, and this section will not present an exhaustive list of every tool you could use. Rather, we focus our attention on the tools that genomic epidemiologists use most frequently for public health investigations or genomic epidemiology studies. 7.2.1 Nextstrain Nextstrain is really three things: An analysis pipeline for building annotated ML phylogenetic trees, A codebase for interactive tree visualization within the browser, and A set of pre-built interactive trees for various pathogens, maintained by the Nextstrain team. These different components, and their different names, can sometimes be a point of confusion for new users, so we’ll unpack them here. 7.2.1.1 Nextstrain Augur Nextstrain Augur is the analysis pipeline that takes in sequence data and performs steps such as aligning multiple sequences together, inferring a ML phylogenetic tree, inferring a molecular clock, and translating the genetic divergence ML tree into a time tree. The last step in a Nextstrain Augur pipeline is to package up all those results into a file that the user can visualize. That output file is called a JSON file, or a “JavaScript Object Notation” file. The Nextstrain JSON file will be formatted such that the file can be visualized with the second thing that Nextstrain is, a package for visualizing trees. 7.2.1.2 Nextstrain Auspice Nextstrain Auspice is a JavaScript-based visualization package. It takes in the JSON file that you generated from running Nextstrain Augur. You can think of the JSON file as holding all of the tree information that you would like to see, and Nextstrain Auspice as the instructions for how to take that file and make it an interactive visualization that you can explore from a web browser window. Notably, Nextstrain Auspice will visualize any tree that is formatted according to the Nextstrain JSON structure, even if you did not build the tree with Nextstrain Augur. As an example of that, you can see that when you perform a phylogenetic placement with UShER, when you open up a subtree it’ll be visualized with Nextstrain Auspice. While UShER’s analysis pipeline performs the phylogenetic placement, they package the subtree up in the Nextstrain JSON format, which it allows it to be opened up and visualized by Nextstrain Auspice. If you have Nextstrain-formatted JSON files that you would like to visualize with Nextstrain Auspice, you can go to auspice.us and drop your JSON file onto the browser window. This will start Auspice running on the input tree in that browser window. 7.2.1.3 nextstrain.org Finally, nextstrain.org is a website where visitors can access interactive Nextstrain trees for various different pathogens and outbreaks, such as trees summarizing the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, the West African Ebola outbreak, or seasonal influenza circulation (among many others). 7.2.2 IQ-TREE To create the genetic divergence tree in a Nextstrain Augur analysis, the pipeline uses an external software package that infers phylogenetic trees using a Maximum Likelihood-based procedure. If you have set up your own Nextstrain Augur pipeline, then you can choose which package you would like Nextstrain Augur to use. Currently, there are three you can choose from: IQ-TREE, RAxML, and FASTTREE. By default, Nextstrain uses IQ-TREE. If you want to generate a Maximum Likelihood genetic divergence tree outside of Nextstain, you can use IQ-TREE on its own, either using the command-line interface, or by specifying an analysis on the IQ-TREE web server, which has a graphic user interface for specifying options. 7.2.3 RAxML RAxML is another commonly used package for Maximum Likelihood-based inference of genetic divergence phylogenetic trees. While it is highly accurate, it can take a long time to run on large datasets. While users frequently run RAxML from a command-line interface, there is a graphical user interface version of RAxML that you can download and use. 7.2.4 BEAST BEAST, which stands for Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees, is a powerful tool for phylogenetic inference and genomic epidemiology. Rather than performing a Maximum Likelihood analysis and generating a single most-likely tree, BEAST uses a Bayesian procedure that generates a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, which can either be summarized by a single tree, or analyzed as a whole. The benefit with having a distribution of trees is that you can more effectively capture phylogenetic uncertainty than you can with a single tree. However, performing this Bayesian sampling procedure can take long periods of time (days to weeks to even months for especially large and complex analyses), especially if you lack access to a scientific computing cluster upon which to run the analysis. Therefore, BEAST is more commonly used for academic genomic epidemiological studies, and may be less useful in public health investigations which prioritize fast turnaround times. BEAST is notable for the evolutionary models that it allows you to run, which enables you to infer how the pathogen population size is changing over time from the phylogenetic tree. This area of genomic epidemiology is often referred to as “phylodynamics” since you are analyzing the dynamics of the pathogen population from the phylogeny. Phylodynamic analysis can be incredibly useful for understanding epidemiology, giving you another datastream from which to infer exponential growth rates, which can be transformed to estimates of \\[R_{0}\\]. Alternatively, you may wish to explore how enactment of different policies impacted pathogen transmission, which may be apparent from estimates of how the pathogen population size changed through time. A deeper discussion of these models and analyses in BEAST is out of scope for this handbook, but there are plenty of online tutorials and documentation for new users looking to try BEAST out. 7.3 When should I use a phylogenetic tree versus a phylogenetic placement? Phylogenetic placements are excellent tools in many respects that provide answers incredibly quickly. Phylogenetic trees take longer to infer, but also conduct additional analyses that are not available from a phylogenetic placement. Given these trade-offs, when should you use which type of analysis? The answer is somewhat subjective, and will be influenced by each user’s particular affinity for different types of analyses and software packages, as well as the user’s comfort interpreting the different types of outputs. That said, we offer the following opinions (and we welcome discussion and debate!) Phylogenetic placements are particularly useful for answering a targeted question about what other sequences your sequence of interest is most closely related to. We like phylogenetic placements for epidemiological questions in which you’d like to know, of all the data out there and available, what looks genetically-related to yours. Some questions that phylogenetic placements are effective for answering include: What sequences are most closely related to mine? Could my outbreak be linked to someone else’s? This is the first time I’ve detected this lineage. Where might it have come from? This person has a travel history. Did their infection result from exposure while traveling? Phylogenetic trees are typically more useful when you want to explore the descriptive epidemiology of an outbreak: person, place, and time. For example, because you can translate a genetic divergence tree into a time tree, something that you cannot do currently with a phylogenetic placement, temporally-resolved phylogenetic trees are preferable for looking at any sort of temporal dynamics within an outbreak, such as: When did my outbreak start? How long has my outbreak been ongoing? How long has this particular lineage been circulating? The ability to also incorporate geographic data into phylogenetic trees via phylogeographic analyses also means that trees can elucidate important geographic dynamics, such as: How is this pathogen moving between different areas? Which different regions appear to be linked or show pathogen exchange? How frequently is this pathogen moving between these different regions? Questions about place and time can also be explored together with phylogenetic trees. For example: How long did this pathogen circulate in my region before moving to a different region? When did this pathogen first arrive to my region, and where did it come from? Is my outbreak sustained by endemic transmission, or is our outbreak frequently being re-seeded from other areas? Finally, phylogenetic trees are preferable when you have questions regarding transmission dynamics, such as: Did our travel policies change how frequently we saw introductions of the pathogen to our region? Did we manage to bring this outbreak to a halt? Has this lineage continued to circulate cryptically within our community, or did we manage to extinguish local transmission completely? 7.4 Selecting contextual data for phylogenetic tree analyses Selecting appropriate contextual data to include in a phylogenetic analysis can be a bit of an art, although as you do it more frequently you will begin to build up your intuition for when you lack sufficient contextual data. Often you will need to assess your contextual data selection iteratively, building your dataset, inferring your tree, looking for areas of the tree that you believe lack sufficient context, refining your dataset, and so on. There is absolutely a need for more systematic strategies for selecting which contextual data to include, and evaluating whether sufficient contextual data have been included in an analysis. But in the meantime, here are some suggestions to get you started. Firstly, try to include external sequences that are nearly-complete and of high quality. This will usually improve the quality of multiple sequence alignment. When sequences with high numbers of N’s are included in the analysis, it becomes hard to align them effectively, and those sequences can get misaligned. The effects of that misalignment can compound, with the misalignment making samples look overly divergent, which can affect your estimate of the evolutionary rate, and even lead to strange topologies within the tree. Secondly, you will often want to include a small number of contextual samples that capture the full extent of an epidemic. For instance, even if you are seeking to describe a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Moosejaw, Canada, you’ll typically want to include a small number of representatively-sampled sequences from every continent where SARS-CoV-2 transmission has occurred, over the entire duration of the pandemic. These sequences help build the “back-bone” of the tree, ensuring that your analysis accurately captures the historical evolutionary dynamics that lead up to your outbreak of interest. Furthermore, the inclusion of this type of contextual data can improve the precision and accuracy of your estimate of the molecular clock, since typically they will have been collected serially over a longer time period. Finally, you will also typically want to include contextual data that are closely-related to your outbreak of interest. You will usually determine which samples fall into this bucket of contextual data by using either your general knowledge of community connectivity or by systematically selecting samples that are minimally genetically diverged from your samples of interest. As an example of the former, perhaps you know a priori that individuals in community A often travel to community B for work, and vice versa. In that case, it would seem reasonable that community A and community B have related outbreaks, and so you would be sure to include sequences from community B in your analysis of community A’s outbreak. As an example of the latter, within Nextstrain analyses of SARS-CoV-2, you can select a set of samples to be your “focal” set, and then ask Nextstrain to include contextual sequences that are genetically-similar to that focal set. Under this procedure, you begin with a large pool of samples from which you could draw your contextual sequences, and you select ones to include in your phylogenetic analysis based off of the number of mutations that differ between those potential contextual sequences and the sequences within your focal set. 7.5 Notes about node ages in temporally-resolved trees Within a time tree, the internal nodes will have estimates of their ages, and some type of confidence range around that estimate. The type of confidence interval will vary depending on whether you have used a Bayesian or Maximum Likelihood method for inferring your time tree. Depending on what software you use, or how you’ve specified your analysis, these node ages may be given as: calendar dates (e.g. March 07, 2017), decimal dates (e.g. 2017.18), an amount of time beyond the age of the root (e.g. the root age is 0 years, and your sample is 1.8 years into the future from the root), or an amount of time into the past as calculated from the youngest tip in the tree (e.g. the most recent tip in your tree was collected on June 10, 2019, and the ancestor that you are interested in is 1.2 years back into the past from that youngest sample). "],["further-concepts.html", "Chapter 8 Further concepts 8.1 Recombination", " Chapter 8 Further concepts In this chapter we describe additional theoretical and practical concepts that you may encounter as you delve more deeply into using genomic epidemiology or reading the genomic epidemiology literature. These concepts likely won’t crop up regularly in bread-and-butter genomic epidemiological applications, but are common enough that they do warrant some discussion and clarification. This Chapter is most pertinent to readers who already have some familiarity with genomic epidemiology, and are seeking to deepen their knowledge. 8.1 Recombination Typically when we talk about evolution, we consider the process by which an organism’s genetic material is copied with random errors (mutations) and passed on to their progeny. Those progeny then have unequal chances of surviving and passing on that inherited variation, with additional mutations sprinkled in, to their offspring. Most probabilistic phylogenetic methods (like maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches) aim to recapitulate this process by inferring whether sequences are more likely to share a mutation because the same mutation happened in other sequences, or because two or more sequences inherited the mutation from a common ancestor. The straightforward model of evolution where genetic material is inherited, mutated during replication, and then passed onto progeny is called clonal evolution, and it is how the vast majority of life evolves. However, recombination is another way to generate genetic variation, and it is frequent addition on top of the process of clonal evolution. To use an analogy, human language is often “inherited” wholesale by offspring during childhood largely unchanged, which resembles clonal evolution. Occasionally, if a child has contact with other languages, they may borrow words from that other language and intersperse it in their speech; that borrowing is similar to how recombination works. In the strictest sense, recombination happens when a strand of genetic material is broken and joined onto another. In complex organisms like animals, recombination is nearly universal and obligatory - during the production of gametes (meiosis), each chromosome we inherited whole from our parents is recombined, i.e. a new chromosome is created by randomly “sampling” regions from one or the other parental chromosome. In non-eukaryotic microorganisms, recombination can integrate extraneous genetic material unrelated to anything in the host’s genome in what is known as horizontal gene transfer, which is a type of non-homologous recombination (non-homologous because the host and incoming genetic material are not related). In RNA viruses specifically, nearly all recombination occurs between related sequences due to the template switching mechanism, whereby the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase dissociates from the original template it had been copying, together with the nascent RNA copy, and binds to a new template that is sufficiently complementary to the nascent copy to pair up and allow the continuation of RNA synthesis. The resulting RNA copy thus ends up being part original template and part new template. Template switching likely takes place during all RNA virus infections, with the exception of negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses which effectively do not recombine. But in most cases, template switching will occur in a genetically homogenous infection in which the old template and the new template will be essentially the same genotype. Thus even with the process of template switching occurring, the resulting recombined sequences will not be distinguishable as such. This means that if you detect recombination in RNA viruses, likely the host had a genetically diverse infection, such as being co-infected with multiple different strains of a virus. Tools for detecting recombination are readily available but are not always well-explained or easy to interpret because they provide single numerical values like p-values, statistics, etc. Tests like these have a place in confirming recombination, but should not replace manual investigations of your sequence data for tell-tale signs of recombination. What are these tell-tale signs? Firstly, you will likely observe an excessive number of repeat mutations; we refer to these as homoplasies. Walking through a toy example, imagine that at some point a virus has an A to G substitution at site 201 of its genome (A201G). If evolution proceeds only clonally, then we would expect that A201G mutation to occur and be passed on to the offspring. Notably, those offspring are descended from the same ancestor, and so they’ll share other parts of the genome as well. This means that the progeny that inherit the A201G mutation will likely cluster together closely in a phylogenetic tree, and a single instance of the A201G mutation that is then inherited by the group of related viruses will explain the phylogenetic pattern. However, if you recombination is occurring, then a genetically diverse set of viruses could “pick up” the genetic material carrying the A201G mutation. On a tree, this would look as though many diverged groups of viruses all have that A201G mutation, even though the rest of their genomes are quite different. If the model strictly assumes clonal evolution, then the model’s only explanation for this A201G pattern across all of these different groups of viruses is to assume that the A201G mutation happened many independent times. And thus, we have excessive repeat instances of A201G: a homoplasy. For another example of homoplasies, we can return to our language analogy from earlier. Many languages, even non-Romance languages, have Latin words. If we assumed that language only evolved clonally, then we would look at these Latin words across all of the different languages, and we would say that they had been invented multiple times independently (this would be the homoplasy). Of course the truth is that Latin words were not invented over and over again, but rather invented once in the Romance language family, and transferred by adoption to non-Romance languages. Another feature of recombination is the spatial clustering of homoplasies along the sequence. This clustering occurs because recombination typically transfers stretches of genetic material, not just a single site. If the donor material is sufficiently diverged from its homologous counterpart in the recipient, then that stretch of genetic material will contain numerous mutations. When unaccounted for, sufficiently recombined sequences used in conjunction with strictly clonal models of evolution lead to nonsensical inferences that can mislead the researcher. Judging how much recombination is too much, and when inferences are sabotaged beyond utility, is not easy and varies from situation to situation. Knowing the biology and ecology of the disease helps. If the pathogen is genetically homogenous, as is the case early in pandemics for example, or if co-infections are known to be rare, it can be argued that recombination is unlikely without even looking at the data. Other clues can also distinguish situations that produce similar signals to recombination from actual recombination. Recall that analysing recombinant sequences in phylogenetic models that are strictly clonal results in algorithms inferring that mutations transferred via recombination are recurring independently (homoplasies). While the recurrence of any given mutation (particularly in larger genomes) seems unlikely, the reality is that so many viral and bacterial progeny are produced during an infection, almost every possible mutation will occur. Thus in the presence of strong selective pressures to solve similar problems, recurrent changes are entirely expected. One of the best examples of this is E627K replacement in the PB2 protein of avian influenza A viruses jumping into humans. Virtually all human cases have this particular mutation, and with sufficient sampling of the virus in birds, it can be shown that this mutation occurs de novo in every single new jump into humans. Only recently was it shown that a specific interaction of the PB2 protein with ANP32A, a host protein that is sufficiently different between birds and humans, is at the root of this extremely strong selective pressure. In contrast, it is uncommon for synonymous mutations to be under similar selective pressures, and thus synonymous mutations are unlikely to recur and are a more believable marker of recombination. One of the most thorough, unambiguous, and elegant demonstrations of recombination was performed by Jackson et al during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to a comprehensive and long-running genomic surveillance programme in the UK, it had been possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 genomes assigned to lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha in WHO VOC nomenclature) but which didn’t have all the mutations/SNPs that B.1.1.7 should have. A closer examination of such genomes revealed that regions missing B.1.1.7 mutations had mutations typical of other lineages, strongly suggestive of recombination. Furthermore, at least four distinct types of recombinant genomes were found, each with multiple sampled genomes sequenced by different groups. This is an extremely useful finding since it suggests that this signal of recombination did not originate from sample contamination or sequencing error. Another important aspect demonstrated by the researchers in this study was that putative parental lineages co-circulated at the same time in similar geographic locations. Figure 8.1: This condensed alignment shows mutations (compared to reference) of closest genomes to putative recombinant parents (first and fifth genomes) and putative recombinants (second, third, and fourth genomes) compared to the reference (sixth genome in grey). Positions 445-21255 contain SNPs typical of lineage B.1.1.7 while everything downstream are SNPs typical of B.1.1.7. One quick test for repeat mutations in such data is the presence of G4 sites which are pairs of alignment columns that only contain two alleles each but have all four possible haplotypes (sequence of SNPs/mutations along the genome) between them. For example, sites 21255 (containing either C or G) and 23063 (containing either A or T) spanning the recombination breakpoint contain all four possible haplotypes: GA (reference), CA (B.1.177), GT (B.1.1.7), and CT (recombinant). The logic of this simple test is that one of the mutations occurred earlier, giving rise to lineages X and Y, while later mutations at another site can only occur in one or the other background. Let’s assume a second mutation occurred in lineage X. The presence of this newer mutation in lineage Y would indicate that either lineage Y acquired the same mutation independently or recombination transferred it from lineage X to Y.
