#Sampling strategies

_In this Chapter we describe two major approaches to sample selection for genomic epidemiological studies. We describe when you should use these different sampling strategies, focusing on which types of questions you may be interested in, and how the particular sampling strategy supports the goal of your investigation. This Chapter is pertinent for any readers who are actively seeking to implement genomic surveillance programs and integrate genomic epidemiology into their public health investigations. Readers who want to understand why different sampling strategies are useful will also benefit from reading these sections._

##Representative Sampling

In representative sampling, a set of specimens are selected for sequencing such that the pathogen genetic diversity in the sequenced sample set is representative of the pathogen genetic diversity circulating in the broader population. This means that the investigator should be able to detect the same suite of genotypes in their sample as circulate in the broader population, and that the frequencies with which they observe different genotypes in their sequenced dataset should reflect the frequencies with which those genotypes are found in the broader population.

To maintain these attributes and protect the validity of their dataset, the investigator must ensure that they do not accidentally enrich for certain genotypes by preferentially sequencing samples that have a particular diagnostic trait, a particular clinical presentation, or affect a particular demographic group.

Furthermore, to maintain a representative dataset, the investigator must also avoid systematically excluding certain genotypes that are circulating in the population. Genotype exclusion can occur when you lack sequences from a particular portion of your population that does not mix homogeneously with everyone else in your population. For example, if you have an under-served population that co-mingles, but has limited contact with other groups in your community, then a certain pathogen genotype could circulate primarily within that community. If that population lacks equitable access to testing, then you may not detect transmission within the community or sequence the circulating genotype(s). This situation would lead you to miss or underestimate the prevalence of those genotypes.

Generally, we recommend using representative sampling when exploring surveillance questions, such as:

* What is the frequency of this variant in my population?

* How are frequencies of these different variants changing over time?

* What is the spatial distribution of different pathogen genotypes?

* When was this particular pathogen genotype introduced to this population, and how long has it circulated for?

* How much pathogen diversity do we observe in our community, and how does this relate to pathogen diversity in other communities?

## Targeted Sampling

In targeted sampling we aim to sequence as many samples as possible from a particular population, outbreak, or transmission chain, in order to understand the specific genotypes and disease dynamics associated with that population or setting. Examples of when we use targeted sampling include:

* Investigating populations showing particular clinical presentations of a disease to see whether a specific pathogen genotype appears correlated with an altered disease presentation.

* Exploring whether an outbreak in a localized setting, such as a workplace, school, or medical facility, is the result of transmission occurring within the setting. Alternatively, infections could be acquired in the broader community, and simply detected in the localized setting, for example due to increased screening in the facility.

* Investigating a particular set of cases that report an epidemiologic link to determine whether they are indeed part of the same transmission chain.  

* Investigating individuals presenting with a second acute period of illness, to distinguish between a reinfection event and reactivation of latent disease.
