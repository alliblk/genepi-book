# Case studies

_In this Chapter, we provide case studies exemplifying how the broad thematic areas of genomic epidemiological analysis described in Chapter 5 can manifest in practice. We intend in this section to show step-by-step how various public health agencies investigated particular questions with a genomic epidemiological approach. Rather than providing the kinds of neat and cohesive narratives we frequently see in peer-reviewed literature, we have tried to show how various hands-on investigations really proceed, including describing when and why we were uncertain, and how we investigated different competing hypotheses. This chapter is most pertinent to readers directly involved in analyzing and interpreting genomic epidemiological studies._
